<br />PHILIP&rsquo;S CHANCE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t <i>stand</i> it, Patty, I simply <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
stand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to, Phil, dear. I&rsquo;m
engaged to Little Billee, and some day I&rsquo;m going
to marry him. And that&rsquo;s all there is about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Patty, that isn&rsquo;t all about it. I&rsquo;m
not going to give you up so easily. You don&rsquo;t
<i>know</i> how I care for you. You&rsquo;ve no idea what
a determined chap I can be,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, stop, Phil. You know you promised
that we should be friends and nothing more.
You promised not to ask for more than my
friendship&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you, now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did but that was only so you&rsquo;d stay
friendly with me, and I thought,&mdash;forgive the
egotism,&mdash;I thought I could yet win your love.
Patty, you don&rsquo;t care such a lot for Farnsworth,
do you, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, Phil. Why, do you suppose
I&rsquo;d be engaged to him if I didn&rsquo;t love him more
than anybody in all the world? Of course I
wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you think so, Patty,&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s handsome
face was grave and kind, &ldquo;but you may
be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Philip, and unless you
change your subject of conversation, I&rsquo;ll have
to ask you to go away. I should think you&rsquo;d
scorn to talk like that to a girl who&rsquo;s engaged
to another man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I would, too, Patty. But I
can&rsquo;t help it. Oh, my girl, my little love, I
can&rsquo;t give you up. I can&rsquo;t tamely stand aside
and make no effort to win you back! I&rsquo;m not
asking anything wrong, Patty, only don&rsquo;t send
me away; let me try once again for you,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late, Phil,&rdquo; and Patty looked a little
frightened at his vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late, until you&rsquo;re actually
married to him. When will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ve only been engaged
a fortnight,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I only learned of it today,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I tried to get you on the telephone,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been down in Washington for a
week or more. But, Patty, dearest, think how
surprised and stunned I was to hear of it. I
came right over, to learn from you, yourself,
if it could be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Philip, it is true, and I&rsquo;m glad and
happy about it. I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve been disappointed,
but&mdash;there are others&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and Van Reypen fairly glared at
her, &ldquo;never imply that there&rsquo;s any one else in
the world for me! Oh, Patty, my little Patty,
I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His great, dark eyes were full of despair,
his face was drawn with sorrow, and Patty forgave
him, even while she resented his attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, Philip,&rdquo; she said, gently; &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t right for you to talk to me like that. I
feel disloyal, even to listen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; Van Reypen burst out.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine! You promised Aunty Van
you&rsquo;d marry me! You <i>promised</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Philip grasped her hand in both his own, and
gazed at her so wildly that Patty was tempted
to run out of the room. But she realised the
matter must be settled once for all, and she
spoke with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re quite
fair to me,&mdash;or to Billee. Is it manly to talk
like this to the girl who is promised to your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re right, Patty.&rdquo; Van
Reypen dropped her hand and folding his arms,
stood and looked at her. &ldquo;But listen to me,
girl. I shall not give up until you&rsquo;re married
to Farnsworth. If I can win you back from
him, I&rsquo;m going to do so. I shall do nothing
wrong. But, dear, I&rsquo;m so miserable,&mdash;so
utterly heart-broken,&mdash;you won&rsquo;t put me out of
your life,&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now one of Patty&rsquo;s strongest traits of character
was her dislike of giving pain to another.
Philip could have put forth no more powerful
argument than an avowal of his disappointment.
Against her better judgment, even
against her own wish, she smiled kindly on
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put you out of my life,
Phil, but I can&rsquo;t let you talk to me like
this,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Patty. Just let me see you once in
a while, let me keep on loving you, and then, if
you really love Bill better than you do me, I&rsquo;ll
see it,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll know it, and I&rsquo;ll give you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, but you must promise not
to tell me you care for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Reypen gave a short, hard laugh. &ldquo;Not
tell you! When I don&rsquo;t tell you, I won&rsquo;t be
breathing! Why, Patty, I can&rsquo;t any more help
telling you, than I can help loving you. But I
promise not to make your life a burden,&mdash;or
myself a nuisance. Trust me, dear. I don&rsquo;t
mean to steal you away from Bill,&mdash;unless you
<i>want</i> to be stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s smile and blush
showed plainly where her heart had been
given.</p>
<p>Phil winced, but he said, blithely, &ldquo;Very good,
my lady. There&rsquo;s no use being too down-hearted
about it all. Give me my chance,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Phil, the time for your &lsquo;chance&rsquo; as you
call it, is past. I&rsquo;m engaged to Little Billee;&mdash;to
me that&rsquo;s as sacred, as unbreakable a promise,
as my marriage vows will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t! Lots of people break off
an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip&rsquo;s lightness annoyed Patty, and her
mood changed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you can so bewitch
me that I <i>want</i> to break my engagement to Bill
Farnsworth, I&rsquo;ll do it, but you&rsquo;ve about as much
chance as&mdash;as nothing at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>make</i> a chance! Oh, Patty, don&rsquo;t forget
you said that! Don&rsquo;t forget you said if I can
win you away from him, I may do so! Listen,
dear. I&rsquo;m not over conceited, or vain, but I
do think that you don&rsquo;t quite know your own
mind, and you&rsquo;re a little bit dazzled by Bill&rsquo;s
big masterfulness and you don&rsquo;t realise that perhaps
there are other things worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, but
I&rsquo;ll stick to my word. And I&rsquo;ll add that I
know you <i>never</i> can cut Bill out, because I love
him too much. So, there now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can&rsquo;t, maybe you&rsquo;re right, but I&rsquo;ll
have a go at it, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you know, I&rsquo;ll tell him of this
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may. There&rsquo;s nothing underhanded
about my determination. If I can win
you from him, it&rsquo;ll be done fairly, and in that
case, Bill&rsquo;s own sense of justice would make
him willing to give you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Billee give me up! Willingly?
<i>Nevaire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;He would, Patty, if you told him yourself
that you loved me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i>! But I&rsquo;ve no expectation of ever
doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say? You&rsquo;re a fickle little thing,
you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are, and always have been. You&rsquo;re
fond of Bill just now, because he&rsquo;s been doing
the caveman act, carrying you off from the
Blaney party, and such things, but you&rsquo;ll soon
tire of him,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Philip! I won&rsquo;t listen to such talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty put her hands over her ears and pouted.
It was nearing twilight of an afternoon in late
January, and the two were in the library of the
Fairfield home. Patty had become engaged to
Farnsworth while on a visit to Adele Kenerley,
and had but lately returned from there.</p>
<p>This was her first interview with Philip since
her engagement, and she had dreaded it, for
she knew Phil&rsquo;s stubborn and persistent nature
would not tamely submit to an end of his hopes.
Patty had firmly resolved that if Philip insisted
on telling her of his love for her, she would
refuse to see him at all; but her gentle heart
could not let her summarily dismiss him. She
temporised, not because she cared for him, or
had the least thought of disloyalty to Farnsworth,
but because she couldn&rsquo;t bear to hurt
him by forbidding him to come to her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>She tried to change the subject. She was sitting
in the corner of a huge davenport, and her
little house dress of pink Georgette was very
becoming. She rather hoped that Farnsworth
would come in while Phil was there, but it was
uncertain whether he could arrive before dinner
or not until evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll talk
about something else, nod your head, and I&rsquo;ll
stay; but if not, shake your head, and I&rsquo;ll run
off to my own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Reypen nodded his head, and Patty took
her hands away from her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, smiling; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll be
just a casual friend, go ahead and be it. But I
don&rsquo;t want to hear any more absurd talk about
people&rsquo;s breaking their engagements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! What shall we talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>This might have proved a dangerous subject,
but clever Philip would not allow it to be. He
was honest and earnest in his love for Patty.
He really believed that she had said yes to
Farnsworth on the spur of the moment, and
that further thought would make her willing to
reconsider her decision. Moreover, he was
quite willing his rival should know of his own
intentions, and he had only feelings of good
fellowship for him. Philip had a sportsman&rsquo;s
nature, and his idea was to let the best man win.
He did not attach quite so much importance to
the fact of the engagement as most people do,
and he truly hoped yet to win Patty&rsquo;s affection
and make her both willing and anxious to dismiss
Bill in his favour.</p>
<p>Patty had not given him any encouragement
for these hopes. In fact, she was so truly in
love with Farnsworth, that it never occurred to
her that she could ever care less for him, or
have any room in her heart for any other man.
But she couldn&rsquo;t seem to say this bluntly to
Philip. She found it easier to let matters drift,
and now, as he began to speak in praise of
Farnsworth, she listened eagerly and assented
and agreed to all Philip said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is splendid,&rdquo; she acquiesced. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know there was such a noble nature in
the world. You see, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about
him since we&rsquo;ve been engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Yes, old Bill is a corker for
bigness in every way. I&rsquo;m banking on his big
nature and his broad outlook, to understand my
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, you&rsquo;re not to talk of &lsquo;your
case&rsquo;! You promised not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With thee conversing, I forget all&mdash;promises!&rdquo;
misquoted Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t, or I&rsquo;ll send you packing!
Thank goodness, here comes Nan; <i>now</i> will
you behave yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairfield came in from out-of-doors, and
drew near the blazing log fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, children, what are you discussing so
seriously?&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;Philip, my friend, if
you please, will you push that bell and let us
have lights and some tea. I&rsquo;ve been to three
committee meetings and I&rsquo;m just about exhausted.
Where&rsquo;s Billee-boy, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t be here until after
dinner. He said it was unlikely he could come
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try to bear it, Patty. Can&rsquo;t Philip
beguile you for a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a great little old beguiler, Phil
is!&rdquo; and Patty smiled at her guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; declared Van Reypen. &ldquo;I
can beguile the birds off the trees,&mdash;but <i>not</i>
Miss Patricia Fairfield, when she is waiting for
her big Little Billee. Howsumever, I&rsquo;ll do my
best. Do I gather that I&rsquo;m asked to dinner in
place of the absentee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are <i>not</i>!&rdquo; replied Patty, promptly, but
Nan said, &ldquo;Why, yes, Phil, stay. I&rsquo;ll entertain
you, if Patty won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ma&rsquo;am. That would suit me all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about your aviation training?
When do you begin that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncertain. I did expect to start for
Wilmington next week, but matters are delayed
by a screw loose in some of the red tape,
and it may be a couple of weeks before I
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t know you thought of going,&rdquo;
put in Patty, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve settled the preliminaries and I&rsquo;m
waiting further orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to Wilmington? Why, we won&rsquo;t see
you any more, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem terribly upset over that!
But, you will see me, I&rsquo;m afraid. Wilmington
is not so very far off, and the course is neither
long nor strenuous. Why, it only takes about
four months in all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then will you really fly? Up in the air,
in big machines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is my firm belief, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you fall and break your neck?
They say they all do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not promise to do that, unless you insist
upon it. And it isn&rsquo;t done as much as formerly,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you two sparring so?&rdquo; asked Nan,
laughingly. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you good friends, at the
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as anybody can be, when the lady
he admires has been and went and gone and
engaged herself to somebody else,&rdquo; and Philip
frowned darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, so that&rsquo;s it! Well, our young friend
here is certainly engaged to her big Western
suitor. Now, shall I look out for a sweet little
girl for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s a case of Patty
or nobody, where I&rsquo;m concerned. But the
game&rsquo;s never out till it&rsquo;s played out. Patty and
Farnsworth may one or both of them yet
change their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so, if you saw them together,&rdquo;
laughed Nan. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just about
the most engagedest pair you ever saw!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t show
our affection in public, Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have great difficulty not to do so.
It&rsquo;s all you can do, to hide it successfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should they?&rdquo; asked Phil.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law against that sort of thing, is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about your aviating,&rdquo; said
Patty, by way of changing the subject. &ldquo;What
do you do to learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno myself, yet. They say the only way
to learn to swim is to be thrown into the water.
So I daresay the way to learn to fly, is to get in
an aeroplane and start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You have to be taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will be taught. But I&rsquo;m going
to be a good aviator. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll like
the stunt, and I want to begin as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could do some war work,&rdquo; and
Patty sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Nan, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
any girl who does more of it than you do,
Patty! When you&rsquo;re not down in that old
office doing clerical work, you&rsquo;re knitting like a
house afire. And you are on two or three committees
and you write slogans for the Food
people and for the Liberty Loan Bonds, and
oh, I don&rsquo;t know what all you do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Philip,
interestedly. &ldquo;Have you been doing these
things long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them,&rdquo; said Patty. &ldquo;But I have
done more of late. I feel so useless unless
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nan, &ldquo;and then you work beyond
your strength, and overtax yourself, and
the first thing you know you will be useless
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Patty? Why these great works?&rdquo;
asked Van Reypen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because of Bill,&rdquo; Nan answered for her.
&ldquo;You see he&rsquo;s so mixed up in war work, that
Patty must needs to do a lot also. And she&rsquo;s
such an extremist, she&rsquo;s not satisfied with doing
a <i>bit</i>, it must be a whole lot of bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe her, Phil,&rdquo; said Patty, gaily.
&ldquo;I do what I can, and no more. Also, I&rsquo;m
going to put a stop to this idea that I&rsquo;m a delicate
plant,&mdash;for I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m as healthy as&mdash;as
a backwoodsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine comparison. Your sturdiness is exactly
that of a backwoodsman! You could haul logs,
if you want to, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be funny. But I am heaps stronger
than I used to be. It&rsquo;s a whole lot better for
me to <i>do</i> things than to sit around and be
coddled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Patty. What are you doing,
that I can help you with? Any sort of work
where you could use a pair of willing
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going off aviating&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t gone yet! Dunno when I will go.
In the mean time let me help you. What&rsquo;s your
newest plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, I&rsquo;m going to help entertain
the boys in khaki. A committee has asked
me to, and if Nan agrees, I mean to devote one
evening a week to it. Say we ask a few to
dinner, and some more to come in the evening,
and have some music and games and make it
pleasant for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in. I&rsquo;ll gladly help out with such
a program. Even after I go to Wilmington, I
can get up here once a fortnight at least,&mdash;maybe,
oftener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now, what I&rsquo;m thinking out, is
how to make it pleasant for the boys we invite.
I&rsquo;d like to give them some real pleasure, not
only some music and silly chatter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such as what? I mean, what have you in
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought of getting some interesting
lecturer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Patty. They don&rsquo;t want lectures,&mdash;of
all things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the most of them want just a home
atmosphere, and a few hours of pleasant company,
without much reference in the chat to
war conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. If you ask half a dozen soldiers
and have your father and Mrs. Fairfield
here, and a few girl friends of yours, if you
like, I&rsquo;ll guarantee your visitors will be better
entertained than if you had the finest lecturer
that ever droned out a lot of platitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Philip, you help me to get up such
a party, and try it,&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will, and that with much quickness.
Shall we say a week from tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes that will be fine. I&rsquo;ll ask Elise
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go too fast. I&rsquo;ll find the khaki boys
first, and then you get the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Patty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />BUMBLE ARRIVES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Patty Popinjay! Where
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Patty was
curled up in a big armchair near the library
fire, waiting for that very voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; she cried in return and jumped
up to be grabbed in the arms of a handsome,
jolly-looking girl who came flying into the
room. &ldquo;Oh, Bumble, I&rsquo;m so glad to see
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumble!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard
that name for years. Let me look at you,
Patty. My! you&rsquo;re prettier than ever! Well,
I just <i>had</i> to come. I couldn&rsquo;t resist, when I
heard of your engagement. Where&rsquo;s the man?
Show him to me at once!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he isn&rsquo;t here, for the moment. But
you&rsquo;ll see him soon. I&rsquo;m only afraid you&rsquo;ll cut
me out. Why, Bumble,&mdash;Helen, I mean,
you&rsquo;re utterly changed from the little girl I
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am&mdash;in appearance,&mdash;but no
other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still the happy-go-lucky, hit-or-miss
little rascal you used to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. Oh, Patty, doesn&rsquo;t it seem
long ago that you spent that summer with us?
And to think I&rsquo;ve scarcely seen you since! Not
since Nan&rsquo;s wedding, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and you only in Philadelphia! It&rsquo;s
ridiculous. But, I&rsquo;ve tried to get you over here
time and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. But I went out West to Stanford,
and I was there so long, I almost lost
track of all my Eastern people. Your Best
Beloved is Western, isn&rsquo;t he? Oh, Patty, tell
me all,&mdash;everything about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time, Helen, honey. For now,
I&rsquo;ll just say that he&rsquo;s the dearest and best man
in the whole world, and that you&rsquo;ll agree to
that when you see him. Now, come up to your
room, and fix yourself up. You look as if you&rsquo;d
been through a whirlwind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always look like that,&rdquo; and Helen Barlow
laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>She was Patty&rsquo;s cousin, and had come to New
York for a visit. She had often been invited
and several times had planned to come, but
something had prevented her, and as the
Barlow family were of a most undependable
sort in the matter of keeping engagements or
appointments, it surprised nobody that Helen
had not carried out her plans. Indeed the surprise
was that she was really here at last, and
Patty stared at her hard to reassure herself
that her guest had positively appeared.</p>
<p>Helen Barlow was a pretty girl, about Patty&rsquo;s
own age. Her soft brown hair was curled
round her ears, in the prevailing mode, but it
showed various wisps out of place, and needed
certain pats and adjustments before a mirror.
Her hat, a brown velvet toque, was a little
askew,&mdash;even more so than she meant it to be,&mdash;and
the long fur stole, over her arm, dragged
on the floor.</p>
<p>Without being positively unkempt, Helen was
untidy, and Patty well remembered that as a
child she had been far more so.</p>
<p>The two girls went up to the room prepared
for Helen, and soon her outer garments went
flying. The hat was tossed on the bed, upside
down; the stole slipped to the floor as the long
cloth coat was wrenched open and one button
pulled off by an impatient twitch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;that old button
was loose, anyway. Oh, Patty, how trim and
tidy <i>you</i> look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was second nature to Patty to be well
groomed, and she would have been sadly uncomfortable
with a button missing or a ribbon
awry, unless intentionally so. For Patty was
no prim young person, but she was by no means
untidy.</p>
<p>She laughed at her cousin&rsquo;s impetuous ways,
and picked up the scattered garments, as fast as
Helen flung them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a maid, Patty? I supposed
of course you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have Jane. She maids Nan and me
both, when we want her. But she does a lot of
other things, too. We don&rsquo;t have as many
servants as we used to. Patriotism has struck
this house, you know, and we&rsquo;ve cut out more
or less of the luxuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! I&rsquo;m patriotic, too. Do
you knit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; who doesn&rsquo;t? Now, Bumble,&mdash;oh,
yes, I&rsquo;m going to call you by the old name
if I want to,&mdash;do try to make yourself look
tidy! Take down your hair and do it over.
Your hair is lovely,&mdash;if you&rsquo;d take a little more
pains with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! Anything to please!&rdquo; and
Helen shook down her short curly mop. &ldquo;Let
me see his picture,&rdquo; she demanded as she
brushed vigorously away. &ldquo;Quick! quick! I
can&rsquo;t wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty ran out of the room, laughing, and returned
with a photograph of Farnsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stunning!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s simply
great! Wherever did you catch him? Are
there any more at home like him? &rsquo;Deed I
<i>will</i> steal him away from you, if I possibly can.
Oh, Patty, do you remember Chester Wilde?
Well, he wants me to marry him, but I can&rsquo;t
see it! That&rsquo;s one reason I ran away from
home, to escape his persistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe you&rsquo;re a belle, Bumble! You&rsquo;re
fascinating, I see. Mercy goodness, you&rsquo;ll cut
poor little me out with everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you cared! Now that you&rsquo;re wooed
and won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t care. You can have all
the others,&mdash;and there are plenty,&mdash;only, so
many of them are going or gone to war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, all my best ones have, too. But
you couldn&rsquo;t like a man who doesn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to
fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say <i>nixy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your Bill do? Is he in camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. You know, he&rsquo;s an expert mining
engineer, and he&rsquo;s used,&mdash;I mean, his services
are used by the government. I can&rsquo;t tell you
all about it, because I don&rsquo;t know all myself;
and what I do know, I&rsquo;m not allowed to tell,
in detail. So don&rsquo;t ask, Helen; just know my
little Billee is doing his full duty,&mdash;and then
some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little! <i>Is</i> he little? He doesn&rsquo;t look so,
from this picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photograph showed only the head and
shoulders of Farnsworth, but it hinted a large
man. However, Patty said, just for fun:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell from that. But I don&rsquo;t
mind how little he is,&mdash;he&rsquo;s all the world to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked a trifle embarrassed, so, thinking
Farnsworth must be decidedly undersized,
Helen dropped the subject.</p>
<p>Her trunk had arrived, and Jane appeared, to
assist in unpacking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get out a pretty frock,&rdquo; Patty directed her
guest, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll help you get into it, and then
we&rsquo;ll go down and see Nan, she&rsquo;ll soon be
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chasing some committee, as usual. We&rsquo;ve
both lost our individuality now, and we&rsquo;re
merged in committees. I&rsquo;m a member of quite
a number, but Nan belongs to more than I do.
Here, Helen, put on this bluet, Georgette,
satinet thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather dressy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too much so. It&rsquo;s nearly tea time, and
people often drop in and I want you to make
a good impression. And for gracious&rsquo; sake, do
your hair more carefully than that! Here, let
me do it,&mdash;or Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Helen dropped into a chair
before the toilette table, while the deft and
willing Jane quickly twisted up the brown
locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Patty, after a final
critical examination. &ldquo;Oh, wait, this sash end
is loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, the snapper&rsquo;s off. Never mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do mind! Helen Barlow, you&rsquo;re as
bumbly as ever! We used to call you that because
you were as heedless and careless as a
bumblebee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was another reason,&rdquo; Helen laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because you were so fat! You&rsquo;ve pretty
nearly gotten over that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, lady, for dem kind woids! A
little guarded, aren&rsquo;t you? Know then, that
my sole end, aim and ambition is to get thin,
really thin,&mdash;slim, slender, willowy,&mdash;merely a
slip of a girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quite achieved all that!&rdquo; and
Patty laughed. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re trying to, I&rsquo;ll
help you. No sweets, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Patty, I haven&rsquo;t tasted candy for
two years! And as a sugar conserver, I&rsquo;m
right there! Not a lump of it comes <i>my</i>
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! Then, with exercise, and
not too much sleep, we&rsquo;ll soon get you into
condition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went down stairs, and found Nan
already there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear old Bumble!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;no, no
Helen for me! I knew you too long by the old
name to change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nan, I don&rsquo;t like it! Please don&rsquo;t.
Such a horrid name!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. I&rsquo;ll try to say Helen, but
if the other slips out sometimes, you must forgive
me. Now, how&rsquo;s everybody? Bob all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! In camp, of course, but he gets home
occasionally, or we go to see him. Dad and
Mother sent all sorts of messages and greetings,&mdash;and
hoped I won&rsquo;t make you too much
trouble&mdash;as if I <i>could</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Nan, warmly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just awfully glad to see you, and you
must stay just as long as you possibly can.
Has Patty been telling you of her latest escapade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wrote me of it,&mdash;that&rsquo;s mostly why I
came. I thought the sight of the flirtatious,
coquettish, altogether frivolous and fickle Patty
Fairfield tied down to one man, would be worth
seeing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; remarked Patty, &ldquo;when you see the
man, you&rsquo;ll not wonder! Anybody would be
glad to be tied to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut Patty out, you know, Nan,&rdquo;
Helen declared, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s more likely she&rsquo;ll
throw him over and fly to some newer
flame,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>very</i> likely,&rdquo; Patty mocked, her eyes
dancing, &ldquo;oh, ve-<i>ry</i> like-<i>ly</i>! When I throw
him over, Bumble, you have my full permission
to pick him up. But until then,&mdash;hands off my
property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea things appeared then, and Patty did
the honours, remarking, &ldquo;Yes, we do have tea,
&rsquo;most every day, and we have sugar in it,&mdash;but
we skimp it some and we don&rsquo;t have really rich
cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to get it,&rdquo; and Helen accepted her
cup. &ldquo;I forgot to get any luncheon, and I&rsquo;ll
just make up for it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon she proceeded to devour cakes
and biscuits, until Patty silently despaired of
ever helping her in a quest for slimness!</p>
<p>But Patty looked at her cousin affectionately.
Helen was so jolly and gay-looking, so wholesome
and smiling, and so sincerely glad to be
with them, that she made herself thoroughly
welcome. Her dark eyes were beaming with
good nature, her round, plump face was alight
with good will and her laughter bubbled forth
like a child&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She put her little fat hand up to her lips.
&ldquo;Honest, I&rsquo;m trying not to giggle so much,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but I just can&rsquo;t help it! When
I&rsquo;m happy, I have to chuckle, and that&rsquo;s all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Giggle all you like, my dear,&rdquo; said Nan,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. There&rsquo;s so much sadness
in the world, that a truly merry laugh like
yours is infectious and does us all good. Now,
make yourself at home, Helen, and don&rsquo;t mind
it if I seem to neglect you. I&rsquo;m not really going
to do that, but I do have an awful lot to
see to,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, Nan. And Patty has, too. But
I&rsquo;ll be a help, not a nuisance,&mdash;you see if I&rsquo;m
not. Why, Patty Fairfield! you said he was
little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original of the photograph she had seen,
strode into the room and when Helen saw big
Bill Farnsworth, she knew Patty had chaffed
her.</p>
<p>Farnsworth went to Patty and grasped both
her hands in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; he said, looking deep into her
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Patty returned, with an answering
gaze, and so true was the sympathy between
them, that a sort of telepathic message was
exchanged and further words were unnecessary.</p>
<p>Then Farnsworth turned to greet Nan, and to
be presented to Miss Helen Barlow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;She told me you were little!&rdquo; Helen exclaimed,
looking at the broad-shouldered giant
who faced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that, I think,&rdquo; Bill smiled at her,
&ldquo;Patty probably called me Little Billee, which
is her pet name for her lord and master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Future lord and master!&rdquo; corrected Patty,
&ldquo;not yet, not yet, my child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Serene I fold my hands, and wait,&rsquo;&rdquo; Farnsworth
quoted, with undisturbed equanimity.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;ve come, Miss Barlow.
Perhaps you can entertain Patty and keep
her from getting <i>too</i> impatient at the time
that must elapse before I can take her for
keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanity Box!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty. &ldquo;Me impatient,
indeed! Just for that, Little Billee,
I&rsquo;ll put the date six months later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later than what? I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d
decided on the date for the festal occasion.
You told me last night you hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m living up to the reputation for fickleness
Helen has just wished on me,&rdquo; Patty laughed.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll give you some tea, Billee mine, if
you&rsquo;d like it. Oh, what a lot of people! You
make the tea, Nan!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Patty left the table to welcome her new
guests. Elise Farrington and Daisy Dow were
followed by Chick Channing and Philip Van
Reypen.</p>
<p>After introductions and greetings all round,
Helen looked about her with an air of great
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is as I thought it would be,&rdquo; she said,
contentedly; &ldquo;I do love afternoon tea, and we
never have it at home. And I love people
dropping in to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the tea?&rdquo; asked Channing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in to the tea, of course. And such
lovely people! I want to know you all at once,
but I suppose I&rsquo;d make better headway by taking
you one at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me first,&rdquo; begged Chick, who was much
attracted by the sprightly newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, me,&rdquo; laughed Philip. &ldquo;You can get
acquainted with me in two minutes,&mdash;I&rsquo;m the
easiest of us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave you till the last,&rdquo; smiled
Helen. &ldquo;After all, I believe I&rsquo;ll talk to the
girls first. I want them to like me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you care about the boys liking
you?&rdquo; said Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will, anyhow,&rdquo; Helen retorted, and
she sat down by Daisy and Elise, ignoring all
the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tea, please,&rdquo; said Philip, sauntering over
to Patty, who had returned to the tea-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One lump or two?&rdquo; she asked, holding the
sugar tongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One and a smile,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Gravely, Patty dropped one lump in his cup,
equally gravely, she gave him an idiotic smile,
that was merely a momentary widening of her
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; commented Phil; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t see
how you manage such a sweet smile! The tea
is &rsquo;most <i>too</i> sweet, I think. Give me another
bit of lemon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said Patty, spearing the
lemon with a little fork. &ldquo;Now, Philip, listen
to me. I want you to do all you can to make it
pleasant for Bumble,&mdash;I mean, Helen, while
she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. I&rsquo;m always nice to your
friends, you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know it, but I want you to be <i>specially</i>
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Say, flowers tonight,&mdash;candy tomorrow,&mdash;opera
invitation as soon as I can
manage it,&mdash;a theatre party,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, now don&rsquo;t overdo it! No;
she doesn&rsquo;t eat candy, but you may send some
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some to you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then not to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil, you said you&rsquo;d be nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will; to both of you. But not to
Bumble&mdash;I mean, Helen, alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t send flowers to me, now that
I&rsquo;m engaged. Come here a minute, please,
Little Billee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours to command,&rdquo; said Farnsworth,
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Philip he can&rsquo;t send me flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip, you can&rsquo;t send Patty flowers,&rdquo; Farnsworth
said, obediently.</p>
<p>There was a smile on his face, but in his voice
there rang a note of command that angered
Van Reypen exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can <i>send</i> them,&rdquo; he returned, defiantly,
&ldquo;she needn&rsquo;t accept them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it that way, then,&rdquo; Bill said, carelessly,
as if the matter were of no moment.
&ldquo;Patty, come out to the dining-room a minute,
will you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumping up, Patty left the room without a
glance at Philip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Farnsworth followed her, and they went into
the dining-room.</p>
<p>They were alone there, and he took her gently
in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Patty?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Van
Reypen been kicking over the traces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he seems to think he&mdash;he likes me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he does. How can he help it?
But, my darling, there&rsquo;s to be no petty jealousy
between us and him. I trust you, dear, too
well, to think for a minute that you&rsquo;d listen to
him if he says things that you don&rsquo;t want to
hear. Now, never think it will bother me, for
it won&rsquo;t. You love me, don&rsquo;t you, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she returned, and the blue eyes that
met his left no room for doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, that&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t give him a
thought. Darling, I&rsquo;ve brought your ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile of pleasure, Farnsworth produced
a lovely ring. It was set with a single
pearl, which he had told Patty suited her far
better than a diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; he asked eagerly. &ldquo;Oh,
Patty Blossom, <i>do</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it the most beautiful ring I ever
saw!&rdquo; she replied, her eyes glistening, as he
slipped it on her finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;My pearl,&rdquo; he whispered, close to her ear,
&ldquo;my Patty Pearl. This seals our betrothal,
and makes you mine forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I any more yours than I was before I
had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you little goose! But this is the bond,&mdash;the
sign manual&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee! <i>what</i> a joke! But I accept
my bond,&mdash;I glory in it! Oh, Billee, what a
beauty pearl it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purest and best I could find,&mdash;for my
own Patty Blossom. Now, I&rsquo;ve bad news,
darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news soon told, Br&rsquo;er Fox,&rdquo; smiled
Patty, quoting from her well-beloved Uncle
Remus. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />CAPTAIN BILL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; said Farnsworth, looking
serious. &ldquo;I have to go to Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty,
&ldquo;one would think you were booked for Kamschatka
or Siberia, the way you say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean, I have to go there to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indefinitely. I&rsquo;ve no idea how long; also&mdash;I
may have to go further yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that&rsquo;s not likely at present. However,
it&rsquo;s bad enough to go to Washington.
How can I leave <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, that won&rsquo;t be practicable. I shall
be in the University Camp, drilling engineers, I
suppose, but I want to do more and bigger
things than that. I can&rsquo;t tell you all about it,
Posy Face, but as soon as I get further orders
I&rsquo;ll know better where I&rsquo;m at.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you bothered and troubled, my Billee
Boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Patty. I don&rsquo;t want to worry you
with it, dearest, and you couldn&rsquo;t understand it
all, anyway, but there is a lot of backbiting and
undermining and wire-pulling in Washington,
and it even mixes into Army and Navy
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to be an undermining
engineer, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty! You little rogue! You&rsquo;d make a
joke out of anything, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I would! Now, Billee, you mustn&rsquo;t
look so down-hearted. You&rsquo;ve got me for a joy
and a comfort,&mdash;not for a burden and a&mdash;a
millstone about your neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to have you about my neck, all right,&mdash;but
you&rsquo;re a featherweight, not a millstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you be? What&rsquo;s this camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Engineering Corps, you mean? Oh,
well, there are a lot of units,&mdash;Camouflage,
Foresters, Gas and Flame, Wireless, Telephone,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, that&rsquo;ll do! I&rsquo;m bewildered.
Which are you to be in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. It looks to me as if I&rsquo;d
be in the Searchlight gang&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about searchlights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. To be sure I&rsquo;ve invented one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Billee, have you? And you never told
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t time. There&rsquo;s only time enough,
when I&rsquo;m with you, to tell you what I think
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovely face was wistful and sweet, the
blue eyes shone with affection and the scarlet
mouth drew down a little at the corners, for
Patty saw by Farnsworth&rsquo;s pained expression,
that he was really disturbed at their coming
separation and the uncertainties of his future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the big man spoke, slowly, &ldquo;I
think you&rsquo;re the loveliest thing God ever made.
A thousand times too good for a big brute of
a man like me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t treat me like a brute,&rdquo; observed
Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I treat you as I think of you,&mdash;a lovely
rose petal of a girl,&mdash;who ought not to hear of
wars or rumours of wars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort, William Farnsworth!
If I were that, I&rsquo;d deserve to be put under a
glass bell, and left there to die of asphyxiation!
I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> a silly roseleaf,&mdash;I&rsquo;m a willing, working
patriot! Why, I&rsquo;m as energetic as&mdash;as
Molly Pitcher or Barbara Frietchie&mdash;or Joan
of Arc!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, dear, that&rsquo;s the right spirit!
But you know, Pattibelle, you&rsquo;re not physically
fitted to go on the rampage, as your flashing
eyes indicate. You&rsquo;re the sort who must &lsquo;stay,
stay at home my heart and rest; homekeeping
hearts are happiest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Billee, you do quote the beautifullest
poetry! Where <i>do</i> you pick it all up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve a store of it somewhere in the top
of my head. And I mean no disparagement
of your enthusiasm, Patty, but you can&rsquo;t do
hard work, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I must knit and knit and knit, I
s&rsquo;pose! Billee, dear, when you go to Washington
why can&rsquo;t I go too, and work in the
Canteen Department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth smiled at her. &ldquo;Do you know
what the Canteen Department is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; but Louise Dempster has gone
to it,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the Commissariat Department, but
it&rsquo;s no place for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t snap my head off! Only
because you&rsquo;re not robust enough for the work.
If you&rsquo;re going in for real help, there&rsquo;s always
the hospital or ambulance work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t, Billee! I&mdash;I&rsquo;d faint, I know!
Oh, dear, I&rsquo;m no good, and never was and
never will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very much good to your Uncle
Samuel I admit,&rdquo; and Farnsworth grinned at
her, &ldquo;but a whole heap of good to one of his
humble citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one!&rdquo; and Bill grabbed her in his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop me,&rdquo; Patty murmured, half smothered
in his shoulder, &ldquo;somebody&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em!&rdquo; But he set her down and began
to speak seriously. &ldquo;You do all you can for
the Red Cross, dear, and that will be your
share. Now, don&rsquo;t worry over it, or think you
ought to get into the game in any other way.
You can&rsquo;t do it, but you can and do accomplish
a whole lot,&mdash;besides your knitting. Blossom
Girl, remember <i>I&rsquo;m</i> in this world, as well as the
rest of the U. S. A. and you&rsquo;ll give <i>me</i> of your
love and fealty and&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I will, Sweet William?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s very soul looked out of her earnest
eyes, and Farnsworth kissed her reverently, &ldquo;I
know you will, darling. Now, you&rsquo;ve helped
me a lot already by your cheery and pleasant
attitude about my going away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know all about it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much myself. I&rsquo;ll have further
instructions soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll rank as a Captain, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Bill! How I will love you
then! Come in the other room, I must tell of
it! Nan, Billee&rsquo;s going to have a uniform!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavenly!&rdquo; cried Helen Barlow. &ldquo;Oh, I
adore uniforms! And Mr. Farnsworth will be
stunning in one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may call him Bill, if you like,&rdquo; said
Patty, in the generosity of her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
it suits him. William is much more dignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it William, then,&rdquo; and Farnsworth
smiled at the saucy-faced girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Farnsworth is the best,&rdquo; said Elise.
&ldquo;The title becomes you, Bill, and I know the
uniform will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a uniform too,&rdquo; said Van
Reypen, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t it become me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; chimed in Channing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting
to be ordered to France any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Chickering Channing! I didn&rsquo;t know
that,&rdquo; cried Patty. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an <i>Officier de liaison</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nothing but an interpreter. But
the French term is so much more impressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is. What do you interpret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words otherwise unintelligible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be pleased to interpret for you.
You see, if a French soldier wants to confide a
state secret to an English-speaking comrade,
and if he doesn&rsquo;t know a word of English, nor
the other chap any French,&mdash;what&rsquo;s to be
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;they call
you in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Miss Barlow. And being conversant
with and fluent in all known tongues,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
just a walking Tower of Babel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A walking dictionary, you mean,&rdquo; laughed
Helen. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a pretty fine position
you hold. I never heard of it before. What&rsquo;s
your rank?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant,&mdash;very much at your service,
Mademoiselle. Shortly, I shall don my khaki,
and then I hope, at last, I&rsquo;ll be respected by my
fellow men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Chick,&rdquo; said Patty, mercilessly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve always been such a cutup&mdash;well, of
course, you were respected,&mdash;but nobody really
stood in awe of you. But a Lieutenant,&mdash;oh,
I&rsquo;m proud of my friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it glorious!&rdquo; cried Helen, and she flew
to the piano and began playing patriotic airs.
They all joined and a brave chorus of young
voices rang out the avowal that the Yanks were
coming over there!</p>
<p>So enthusiastically did Helen pound the keys
that her hair shook loose from its pins and came
tumbling round her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Bumble,&rdquo; remonstrated Patty,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t do so,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t done! Here, I&rsquo;ll fix it
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Helen only laughed, and nimbly twisted
up her tousled locks, and thrust hairpins in to
hold them in a hard and unbecoming knot at
the back of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look a bit nice,&rdquo; Elise warned her.
&ldquo;Better let Patty rearrange it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; and the wilful girl kept
on playing and laughed as she shook her head.
The shaking sent her hair down again, and
this time Patty determinedly went to her and
dressed it for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still, you naughty!&rdquo; she said, herself
shaking with laughter. &ldquo;Oh, Bumble, you
haven&rsquo;t grown up a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty did up her cousin&rsquo;s hair prettily and
skewered it firmly into place with many hairpins,
and it didn&rsquo;t come down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you going down to Washington,
too, Chick?&rdquo; Daisy Dow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later, yes. That&rsquo;s the road to all
war glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nor I nor nobody knows. You see,
Daisy, in war affairs nobody knows anything
and if they do they&rsquo;re not allowed to tell
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just among us,&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls have ears,&rdquo; said Chick, mock-dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rumour has a thousand tongues,&rdquo;
added Farnsworth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a dangerous combination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>A week later the two went to Washington.
Sent for nearly at the same time, Farnsworth
and Channing were to go to Washington,
though their work there was widely different.</p>
<p>The night before their departure, there was a
gathering of the clan at Patty&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Farnsworth begged her not to have others
there on their last evening together, but Patty&rsquo;s
wise little head thought it better to have a
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said to Nan, &ldquo;if I spend the
evening alone with my Billee Boy, he&rsquo;ll be so
sad and blue, and I&rsquo;ll be so weepy and red,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
have an awful time! It&rsquo;s a whole lot
better to have the crowd here and let him go
off in a blaze of glory! Patriotism is good for
homesickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, too, Patty was trying to entertain Helen
pleasantly, and so she made many little parties
for her.</p>
<p>The plan of entertaining the other soldiers
was postponed until they could do no more
for their own friends, and the little party to
speed their parting, though small, was gay and
festive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dance,&rdquo; Patty decided. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
just a sit-around, woeful, sighful time. A
good, lively dance, and a nice supper, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Patty choked, and Nan seeing the springing
tears, quickly began to discuss details of the
supper.</p>
<p>The evening came, and Patty dressed in white,
went to Helen&rsquo;s room to make sure she was
in proper order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen Barlow!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;re not an apple-pie pink of perfection!
Not a bow coming off, and your hair positively
looks as if it would stay put!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me, Patty. Truly, I&rsquo;m trying
to do better,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old thing! I was a wretch to
seem to tease you. Wait till this ball is over
and you get off that very bewitching frock, and
I&rsquo;ll give you a kiss of forgiveness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked very pretty in her evening dress
of soft, thin pink, with touches of silver lace,
and silver slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fairy,&rdquo; said Patty. &ldquo;How that
frock becomes you. Now, be gay and festive,
won&rsquo;t you, Helen, honey, for I feel as if I
should burst into a flood of tears every
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on down, Patty,&rdquo; said Helen, drawing
back, &ldquo;I hear Billee&rsquo;s voice, and he&rsquo;ll want you
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t. If I do, I&rsquo;ll cry. Come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So both girls ran down stairs, and shrieked
with delight at the sight of Farnsworth in
uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be stunning,&rdquo; said Helen,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d look like a Herculean
statue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Patty, &ldquo;he looks like
a&mdash;a General! He ought to be&mdash;oh, what
do you call it when you have your statue
taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sculped,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it! He ought to be sculped in
marble or bronze or whatever is most used for
statues this year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, kiddies, run away and play,&rdquo;
said Farnsworth, towering to his full height
and looking every inch a soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; declared Patty, &ldquo;we want to look
at you. Turn around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Channing came, and he, too, was resplendent
in his new khaki, and the girls praised
his appearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drink it in, Bill,&rdquo; Chick said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a
long time before we get any more of this sort
of thing! Somepin tells me the people we&rsquo;re
going amongst won&rsquo;t pay any special attention
to our uniforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they help it?&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;why,
I don&rsquo;t believe any of the United States Army
will look half as well as you two! You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re
superb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bit embarrassed, Channing tried to turn
the subject, but Farnsworth laughed good-humouredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em rave, Channing. They enjoy it,
and I guess we can stand it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; Patty said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re tickled to death
to be so admired! Here comes Elise, now
you&rsquo;ll get more flattery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the other guests came and the party
soon was in full swing.</p>
<p>Patty was among the gayest there. Her eyes
shone and her smile was merry and sweet. But
a flush showed on each pink cheek, and Farnsworth
kept watch of her as she danced or
engaged in light banter with the young
people.</p>
<p>Helen Barlow was frankly delighted with the
party. She was a belle, indeed, for she was a
charming dancer and her never-failing fund of
fun and laughter kept her partners enchanted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like to dance with you,&rdquo; she said to Farnsworth,
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re so big. It&rsquo;s like dancing
with one of the statues in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you girls look on me as a statue?&rdquo;
he returned, laughing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
statuesque about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not that, it&rsquo;s your heroic size&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s not <i>all</i> my heroism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, too. But are you going to need
heroism? Bravery, I mean, and courage and
all that. I thought you were only going to
teach the young engineers how to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of my duty, but there may be
other work cut out for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Patty thinks. She thinks,&mdash;because
you can&rsquo;t tell her all about it,&mdash;that
you&rsquo;re going to be called to some fearful
danger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Helen, she doesn&rsquo;t think
that, does she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes she does. She didn&rsquo;t exactly tell me so,
but she can&rsquo;t hide it from me. I can read that
girl pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t see her off her guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean. Just now, she is
trying her best to be gay; trying so hard, indeed,
that she&rsquo;s overdoing it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I mean. You can tell by
the way she laughs. A little hysterical giggle,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
not like Patty&rsquo;s own hearty chuckle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Helen; and you&rsquo;re a good
friend to Patty. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here with
her. Can you stay some time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as long as she wants me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look out for her, won&rsquo;t you? She&rsquo;s
a frail little thing, and her heart and her energies
are too big for her physique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Bill. But I&rsquo;ll look after her,&mdash;all
she&rsquo;ll let me. She has a strong will, I can
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are talking about me, I can sense
it!&rdquo; cried Patty herself, coming up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to talk
to you, instead. Helen, I see your next partner
coming hot haste to claim you, so I&rsquo;m going to
take Pattibelle aside and treat her to a small
lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willingly Patty went with him, and he led her
to the little room which was her father&rsquo;s den.</p>
<p>There chanced to be no one there, so Farnsworth
closed the door after them, and then
gently took her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must be careful of
my own little Patty girl while I am away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to go,&rdquo; she whispered,
her lip trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, dear, and I don&rsquo;t want to leave
you. But we&rsquo;re always going to obey the call
of duty, aren&rsquo;t we, Patty mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen, sweetheart. You mustn&rsquo;t
exaggerate our parting. I&rsquo;m only going to
Washington&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;but&mdash;you may be sent to
France&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cross that bridge until you come to it.
Now, my own,&mdash;my blessed little girl, I&rsquo;m
going now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I stay here you&rsquo;ll go all to pieces
pretty soon. So I&rsquo;m going now, and I&rsquo;m going
to say good-bye, cheerfully, even calmly,&mdash;because
it&rsquo;s better so. Then you go back to the
party and be as gay as you like, and forget our
case entirely. Trust me, dear little girl,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
better so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty realised the truth of Farnsworth&rsquo;s
words. She was under great nervous strain,
and after his departure, she knew she could
regain her poise and better conceal and control
her feelings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you dear old Billee. I&rsquo;m a
little fool, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I oughtn&rsquo;t to
have planned this affair the way I did, but I
didn&rsquo;t realise,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t, and you overestimated
your own power of will. Now, my love, my
little sweetheart, kiss me once, for soldier&rsquo;s
luck, and then I&rsquo;ll go,&mdash;and you must bid me
good-bye with a smile,&mdash;a smile that I&rsquo;ll carry
with me always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently, solemnly, Patty raised her face to his,
and bending down, Farnsworth kissed the sweet
lips that quivered beneath his touch.</p>
<p>It almost unnerved him, but, determinedly, he
smiled at her, and said, cheerily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write
often and so must you, and,&mdash;why, my goodness,
Patty,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be back soon on leave, and
we&rsquo;ll laugh at this tragic parting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we won&rsquo;t laugh at it my Little Billee,&mdash;no,
not that,&mdash;but,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll try to smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And succeed! Show me how, <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty smiled with real cheer, and clasping her
quickly, Farnsworth gave her one big, farewell
kiss, and rushed out of the door, closing it
behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE BOYS IN KHAKI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was the best plan, but I did hate
to have him run off like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did, Pattykins, but
you would have flown into forty conniption fits
if he had stayed longer. I saw you, and you
were getting all nervous and &lsquo;stericky!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not! You exaggerate so, Bumble,
and I won&rsquo;t stand it! I was upset, of course,
at the thought of his going, but I had absolute
control of my nerves. It was all my own fault,&mdash;having
the party, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had the party for me, my child. Don&rsquo;t
think you can fool your grandmother! But it&rsquo;s
all right, and I promised that Sweet William
of yours that I&rsquo;d chirk you up, and keep you so
interested and amused that you&rsquo;d forget his
very existence,&mdash;let alone forgetting his absence.
Besides, there&rsquo;s a strong belief current
in the best circles that absence makes the heart
grow fonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t ours,&mdash;we&rsquo;re all the fond there is,
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turtle-doves! Well, give me a bit more
chocolate, and we&rsquo;ll call it square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls, in boudoir gowns and caps,
were having their morning chocolate in Patty&rsquo;s
room, and had eagerly been rehearsing and discussing
the party of the night before.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s pretty hair was tousled and her cap
askew, as, perched cross-legged on a couch, she
nibbled toast and sipped chocolate contentedly.</p>
<p>Patty, fresh and tidy as a rose, sat near by
and did the honours of the breakfast tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, absent-mindedly piling
sugar into Helen&rsquo;s cup, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to be
sensible about this thing. I&rsquo;m not going
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get a Food Controller after
you if you are so lavish with that sugar! For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Patty, stop! That&rsquo;s the third
spoonful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? I wasn&rsquo;t looking. As I say, I&rsquo;m going
to be sensible about Little Billee&rsquo;s going
away. He&rsquo;s got to go, and so I may as well
make up my mind to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sensible, indeed! Yet it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me
such a marvellous triumph of intellect or such a
phenomenal force of will that brings about that
resolve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one more minute I shall throw a pillow at
you, Bumble! I guess if you were engaged to
the biggest man in the world, you wouldn&rsquo;t let
him walk off to war&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going with the whole</p>
<p class="t0">Of his patriotic soul,</p>
<p class="t0">At the call of his country&rsquo;s flag!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>sang Helen, trilling the refrain of a song they
had all sung the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. And what am <i>I</i> to stand out
against Uncle Samuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, be patriotic and you will be
happy,&mdash;you are a nice child, Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> would be, if you weren&rsquo;t so silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me silly! Ah, well, better judges are better
pleased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen rolled her eyes skyward, in mock resignation,
and then began to finger over Patty&rsquo;s
engagement book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, Elise&rsquo;s party,&rdquo; she read; &ldquo;will
that be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she has lovely parties. And, write
it in there for me, Bumble, we&rsquo;ve decided on
next Monday night for a party for the boys in
khaki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll put it down. Who did the
deciding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil and I, last night. He says he&rsquo;ll make
application to the Y. M. C. A. committee or
something and have them send us the pick of
the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny! The best-looking ones? Do
they have to pass an exam for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be idiotic! Let me tell you, the most
desirable ones are merely the ones who most
need a little pleasure or entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps the ones who
are farthest from home and mother,&mdash;or, who
have been ill,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or parted from their best girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those are the saddest cases, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead, I&rsquo;ll be best girl to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Philip knows the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaplain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the somebody, who will pick out the
boys,&mdash;soldiers and sailors both, and I&rsquo;ve
agreed to entertain a few every Monday night,
for the present, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good girl, Patty; you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i> you, dear, for your generous
praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I foresee these parties will so interest
and entertain you, that I&rsquo;ll not have to work so
hard to keep my agreement with your big man
to divert your saddened and aching heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart&rsquo;s outside your jurisdiction,&mdash;and
beside, I&rsquo;m doing this party to entertain you.
You know, one can&rsquo;t have a guest without making
strenuous efforts to keep said guest merry
and bright, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, yes, true! But, give me half a chance,
and I&rsquo;ll entertain myself. Give me a pleasant
home to visit, a lovely hostess, like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i> you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Nan, and a few young men, and I&rsquo;ll
ask nothing further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to be left out of your scheme of
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! my angel child, not so, but far
otherwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vivacious visitor flung aside her pillows
and jumped up to embrace Patty in a whirlwind
flash of affection. Greatly given to chaffing,
Helen was truly fond of Patty, and the two
were congenial and affectionate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, one more tiny pour of chocolate, and
one more popover, and my matutinal meal is
finished,&rdquo; Helen said, resuming her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bumble! You know you are welcome
to all you want, and more too, but&mdash;but I
thought you <i>did</i> want to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help this too, too solid flesh to melt?
Well, so I do,&mdash;but Patsy, poppet, your
talented cook does make such delectable dainties
that I can&rsquo;t resist. Just a teenty-weenty
drop of choclum, there&rsquo;s a dear, sweet cousin-girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty laughed and gave Helen another cup
full of the delicious cocoa, and turned her
glance aside, as a popover was lavishly
buttered.</p>
<p>The morning mail came then, and as Jane
brought the girls their letters, Helen took hers,
and suddenly gave a deep and hollow groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Patty, but half-heartedly,
as her mail contained a letter from
Little Billee, which she was eagerly devouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter enough!&rdquo; wailed Bumble, &ldquo;that
botheration, that pest of my existence, that
everlasting nuisance, Chester Wilde, is coming
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here? When?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. Soon, he says. Today, most
likely. I think I&rsquo;ll telephone him not to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why don&rsquo;t you let him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s such a persistent&mdash;er, wooer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for him, Helen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough to marry him, as he insists I
must do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, let him come. I&rsquo;ll talk to him, if
you don&rsquo;t want to. When may he be
expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, I suppose. Oh, of course, he&rsquo;ll only
come to call,&mdash;and I forbid you, Patty, to ask
him to stay to dinner&mdash;or to come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wowly-wow-wow! What a cruel fair she
is! All right, Bumble, dear, just as you say.
And now, scoot back to your own room,&mdash;unless
you want more chocolate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; and Bumble looked longingly at the
tray. &ldquo;No,&mdash;<i>no!</i> of <i>course</i> not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty laughed, and gently pushed her visitor
out of the room, lest temptation again overcome
her.</p>
<p>The Monday evenings planned for the enjoyment
of the boys in uniform began to take
shape and rapidly acquired considerable proportions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Philip Van Reypen was a fine organiser and
Helen Barlow ably seconded his efforts, while
Patty agreed and helped in matters of detail.</p>
<p>Elise was interested and there were half a
dozen more of their own crowd ready to help
in any way available. Chester Wilde had put
in an appearance and Patty liked him from the
first. A quick-witted, pleasant-mannered young
man, himself engaged in some clerical war
work, he declared his willingness to come over
from his home in Philadelphia and help with
the Monday night parties.</p>
<p>Helen Barlow&rsquo;s pretended dislike of him was
merely coquetry, Patty surmised, and then as
the elder Fairfields approved of young Wilde,
he soon became a frequent and welcome
visitor.</p>
<p>Patty adhered to her plan of giving the enlisted
men evenings of real pleasure, and entertainment
that was enjoyable to educated and
cultured minds. For the first evening, they
planned a series of Living Pictures, for, said
the sagacious Patty, &ldquo;give &rsquo;em something to
look at that&rsquo;s pretty and they&rsquo;re bound to
like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise Farrington and Daisy Dow were enthusiastic
workers, and Mona and Roger Farrington
promised any help asked for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>As Farnsworth and Chick Channing were both
gone away, the circle of Patty&rsquo;s friends was
depleted as to men, but Chester Wilde was a
good help and two or three other men were
invited to assist.</p>
<p>Philip Van Reypen was still in the city, and
his great efficiency and good taste and judgment
made him a valuable ally for the cause.</p>
<p>He and Patty planned the pictures, for Helen
Barlow knew nothing of such matters and
Chester Wilde was better at carrying out
orders than originating plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this scheme,&rdquo; Van
Reypen asked of Patty as they began on the
actual selection of subjects. &ldquo;Say, three pictures,&mdash;tableaux,
you know, and have each of
them introduce a bit of entertainment of
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fine,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;if only I had the
least idea of what you&rsquo;re driving at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have. Here&rsquo;s the gist of it. Say,
an Oriental scene. Ladies in rich Persian
draperies and fallals posed about; men in the
gorgeous Eastern robes affected by our heathen
contemporaries; all the properties and effects in
harmony,&mdash;you know I&rsquo;ve oodles of that junk&mdash;and
the whole scene glittering and radiant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! Great! But is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so but far otherwise. Now, after the
eager audience have feasted their eyes on the
sight, and you know, it isn&rsquo;t to be a motionless
picture,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be a motion picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, in this sense. The ladies and the men
walk about, or languidly wave their peacock
feather fans, or sink gracefully on divans, but
of course, no words are spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pantomime, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; rather like a pantomime. Well, then,
in comes an Oriental juggler, who does
tricks,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see! Oh, Phil, that&rsquo;s splendid! Just
what I wanted! And he does real tricks,&mdash;good
tricks,&mdash;and they interest the audience of
themselves, and at the same time there&rsquo;s the
beautiful scenic effect going on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;a poor scheme,&mdash;but mine own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine scheme! Oh, I see enormous possibilities
in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps on another occasion, a Sylvan
scene,&mdash;a woodland effect,&mdash;and in it give a bit
of &lsquo;As You Like It,&rsquo; or something of that sort.
Another time, a Venetian scene, and you can
sing with the gondoliers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do! Then you&rsquo;ve no further need
of my services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly! Of course I want you.
I couldn&rsquo;t do any of it alone. How long before
you go to Wilmington, or wherever you&rsquo;re
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno! but it won&rsquo;t matter. I can run up
here often. An aviator&rsquo;s life is not a busy
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Why isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is, of course, in a sense. But there&rsquo;s
not the same strenuous rush there is in other
fields. You see we&rsquo;re not fly-by-nights, for one
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, outside daylight hours you&rsquo;re free
to play by yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not all of that, but, don&rsquo;t you worry,
my lady, I&rsquo;ll play hookey, if need be, to get up
here to look after your interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now we can&rsquo;t put a whole lot of
time and trouble on rehearsals and all that, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; my idea was to have these things almost
impromptu. Let us plan it all out pretty well
beforehand, and then let the performers each
time come early, and get posted as to their
parts, and the star performer will do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Star performer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I mean, each time have an entertainer,
like the juggler&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A professional?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. I know a chap who does
wonderful legerdemain, who&rsquo;d be glad to come
to entertain Our Boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see. And I&rsquo;ll sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can sing, as special character in
some tableau, don&rsquo;t you see? You could be a
mermaid or a Lorelei, sitting on a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a lute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and your hair down, and a gold comb
and a mirror, while you comb your shining
goldilocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy! Not my hair down. All the rest,
but now I&rsquo;m engaged, I&rsquo;ve put away childish
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, don&rsquo;t be a silly! But never mind
those details. And, too, if you don&rsquo;t fancy the
mermaid r&ocirc;le, have a bit of a scene about &lsquo;tenting
tonight on the old camp ground,&rsquo; and you
can come on as a Red Cross nurse, and
sing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and the boys in khaki can help
make up the picture!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course they can. And another time, we&rsquo;ll
get up a ship scene, I don&rsquo;t know just how yet,
but I&rsquo;ll plan it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have the mermaid come to the
side of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, coming around to the mermaid r&ocirc;le, are
you? Well, those schemes are all right. Now,
what shall we choose for the first one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not soldiers or sailors. Let them see some
stunning show first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oriental?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. Your idea of the juggler
is splendid. He can come on the stage like
those Hindoo fakirs, you know,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s not so very much
room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go over to Elise&rsquo;s, and have it all
in her casino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&mdash;not at first, anyway. You see, Phil,
I suppose it is nothing but pride and vain glory,&mdash;but
<i>I</i> thought up this plan,&mdash;and I want to
have it in my own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you shall! I don&rsquo;t blame you. If Elise
wants to, let her get up something herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably she will. But I want mine here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Patty-girl. Why, there&rsquo;s
plenty of room. We needn&rsquo;t ask so very many
guests,&mdash;say a dozen or so the first time, and
see how it works out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we could accommodate twenty or
twenty-four, I think. You see we&rsquo;d use these
connecting rooms, and this room would hold
about thirty chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now, say we plan the scene.
I&rsquo;ve all that big chest full of Oriental costumes,
you know, and we don&rsquo;t want very much in the
way of actual scenery. A couple of divans
heaped with pillows, and some of those hookah
pipes standing round&mdash;then, the people in costume,&mdash;there&rsquo;s
your setting,&mdash;see? Then, in
comes your juggler, also in appropriate costume,
and he does his tricks, and the people on
the stage admire and applaud, and the people
in the audience do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! And afterward, we have a little
feast, and a little dance, and maybe sing a song
or two for a good-night chorus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket! Now, for the list of
those who take part, and a few details of that
sort, and our preliminary work is done!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />A FIRE-EATER</h2>
<p>The Monday night party was in full
swing. A stage had been erected and
the spectacle that was seen as the curtain
rose was of &ldquo;more than Oriental splendour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heavy draperies, potted palms, strange
braziers and lanterns, pillowed divans,&mdash;all
formed a brilliant and interesting picture of an
Eastern interior.</p>
<p>Richly garbed ladies sat at ease while slaves
waved peacock feather fans above their bejeweled
heads. Stalwart men stood about, picturesque
in their embroidered tunics and voluminous
mantles.</p>
<p>The movement of the scene increased. Slaves
entered with baskets of fruits, musicians came
and made weird music, and dancing girls appeared
and gave graceful exhibitions of their
art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Patty was one of these. In a charming costume
of thin, fluttering silks and gauzy veils,
she went through the slow swaying steps of a
characteristic dance, and enthralled the appreciative
audience.</p>
<p>She had indeed achieved her desire to give
her guests something different from the average
evening entertainment. The young men in
khaki and in blue, who sat watching, were
breathlessly attentive and applauded loudly and
often.</p>
<p>The whole assemblage was gay and merry.
The elder Fairfields were excellent hosts, and
chatted with the uniformed guests until even the
shy ones felt at ease. Roger and Mona Farrington,
too, assisted in this work of getting
acquainted, and the result was a pleasant, chatty
atmosphere and not merely a silent audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; said Roger, approvingly, to
a khakied youth, as Patty executed a difficult
pirouette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; was the earnest reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen some dancing, but never anything to beat
that! Is she on the regular stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. She&rsquo;s the daughter of the house.
But she&rsquo;s a born dancer and has always loved
the art.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wonder! She puts it all over anybody
I ever saw! And the whole colouring,&mdash;the
scene, you know,&mdash;well, it&rsquo;ll be something
to remember when I&rsquo;m back in camp. A thing
like that stays in your mind, you know, and I&rsquo;ll
shut my eyes and see those furling pink veils as
plain, &rsquo;most, as I do now. What a beautiful
girl she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was almost reverential, and Roger
instinctively liked the simple straightforwardness
of his comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and as lovely as she is beautiful. She&rsquo;s
engaged to a Captain, and it&rsquo;s hard luck that
he has to be away from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all of that! Hullo, look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the people on the stage there appeared
a strange figure. It was a man of swarthy
countenance, garbed in pure white draperies, so
full and flowing, that he resembled the pictures
of the prophets. He walked slowly to the
centre of the stage, and made deep salaams to
the characters there assembled, then turned
and bowed low to the audience. His snow-white,
coiled turban almost swept the floor as
he gracefully bent in greeting. Then he rose,
and began to chant a strange weird incantation.</p>
<p>An assistant brought a small tripod filled with
various paraphernalia, and the juggler began
his tricks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>They consisted of the most mystifying legerdemain
and magical illusions, for the performer,
as Philip had assured Patty, was an expert,
though not a professional.</p>
<p>The soldier boys and sailor boys were delighted,
and watched closely in their desire to
see how the tricks were done.</p>
<p>And this paved the way to their still greater
satisfaction, for the accommodating magician
acceded to several urgent requests and explained
his tricks.</p>
<p>To be sure, it detracted from the mystery, but
it added to the interest.</p>
<p>One of his startling deeds was this.</p>
<p>An attendant brought to the magician a small
iron dish filled with kerosene oil. With an
eager smile, as of delighted anticipation, the
juggler, who spoke no word, made motions for
his aid to light the oil.</p>
<p>This was done, and the flames proved it to be
real oil and really burning.</p>
<p>Then, taking an iron spoon, the magician
dipped out a spoonful of the blazing oil and
putting it in his mouth swallowed it with great
apparent relish and enjoyment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>He nodded his head and smacked his lips in
praise of this strange food, and made a gesture
of wanting more. Obligingly, the attendant
offered him the iron bowl again, and again a
spoonful of blazing kerosene was gobbled up
by the hungry feeder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; cried one of the audience, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard of fire-eaters, but I never expected to see
one! Have another dip, old chap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling acquiescence, the juggler repeated his
startling partaking of the oil, and seemed to
like it quite as much as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give up!&rdquo; cried the interested observer,
who had spoken before. &ldquo;Do tell us
how you do that! I&rsquo;d rather know that than
eat a square meal myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping for the moment his r&ocirc;le of pantomimist,
the juggler said, &ldquo;I will tell you, for it
is an interesting trick. For years,&mdash;ages, even,
the Hindus mystified and deceived people by
pretending to be fire-eaters. The ignorant on-lookers,
of course, believed that the fakirs
really ate fire,&mdash;hot coals, blazing oil, or burning
tow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;But as a matter of fact, it was all trickery,
and deception of the simplest kind. You must
know the ignorant people of the Far East are
much more gullible and easily deceived than our
own alert, up-to-date modern and civilised citizens.
And, yet, even among ourselves, it is not
easy to understand the fire-eating illusion. This
is real kerosene, it is really lighted, you have
seen my apparent relish of it. Now can any
one explain how it is that I take spoonful after
spoonful, yet my mouth is not burnt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody could guess, and one after another
said so. The young men were losing their shyness
and self-consciousness in their interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spill it, boss,&rdquo; urged one, &ldquo;give us the right
dope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d be glad to be informed as to the
<i>modus operandi</i>,&rdquo; said another, who was of a
different mental type. Indeed, it was all sorts
and conditions of brains that were striving to
see through this absorbing problem.</p>
<p>Patty, still in her place on the stage, looked
keenly into the upturned faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, brave boys!&rdquo; she thought to herself;
&ldquo;sooner or later, going &lsquo;over there&rsquo; to fight
for us and our cause! I am glad to give them
a little cheer and fun as occasion offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder Fairfields felt the same way, and all
who were helping Patty in her plan were conscious
of a thrill of gratification at the success
of it, so far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it on the vaudeville stage in Paris,&rdquo;
one different looking youth spoke up. &ldquo;It was
slightly different in effect, but I suppose the
same principle obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; agreed the juggler, whose name
was Mr. Peckham. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll show you. The
whole secret is that when I apparently take up
a spoonful of oil, in reality, I only dip the spoon
in and out again. It comes out blazing, to be
sure, but really empty. It is merely the slight
film of oil adhering to the spoon that blazes.
However, this is quite enough to give the effect
of a full spoon of kerosene on fire. Then, as
I throw back my head, as if to swallow this
flaming fluid, I really blow out the flame and I
am careful not even to allow the hot spoon to
touch my lips. But the audience, if the trick
is quickly done, see what they expect to see.
They are imbued with the idea that I am swallowing
a spoonful of burning kerosene, and
they therefore think I do so. It is over in a
second,&mdash;I am swallowing, and smacking my
lips, and it is taken for granted that I have
done the impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the youth who had &ldquo;wanted to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Mr. Peckham, laughing,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Huh!&rsquo; after the secret is told! No
trick is as wonderful after it is explained as it
is before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to me,&rdquo; said a more thoughtful man;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s interesting to see how a mere optical illusion
is believed to be real by thinking and
attentive minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; added Mr. Peckham, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s strange to realise how our eyes see, or we
think they see, what we expect to see. You
anticipated my fire-eating, you looked forward
to seeing it, therefore, you thought you did
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir! After all, it&rsquo;s a sort of
camouflage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! I give you something that looks
like fire-eating, and you think it <i>is</i> fire-eating!
Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he performed many other tricks; tricks
with cards or with other paraphernalia; tricks
with balls, swords, hats, all the usual branches
of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; and the enthralled audience were
so entertained and spellbound, that the time
slipped by unheeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Patty suddenly, from
her place on the stage, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it getting late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past eleven,&rdquo; Roger informed her,
from the audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must stop this magicking! I&rsquo;m
sorry, for I could watch it all night, but there&rsquo;s
more programme yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; cried a youthful chap in sailor
blue; &ldquo;give us more hocus-pocus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight,&rdquo; laughed Patty, and leaving her
place, the whole tableau began to break up and
the gorgeously attired Orientals came down
among the audience and mingled as one
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough,&rdquo; Patty said, pausing
to speak to Mr. Peckham; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so kind of
you, and I&rsquo;ve been so interested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; asserted the kind and
genial man, &ldquo;glad to do it for Van Reypen&rsquo;s
sake, for Our Boys&rsquo; sake, and, most of all, Miss
Fairfield, for your sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty rewarded him with her best smile and
ran away to look after the rest of her entertainment.</p>
<p>There was to have been music and some other
matters, but it was now so late that it was time
for the supper.</p>
<p>This was a simple but very satisfying repast
and the men in uniform showed their appreciation
of Patty&rsquo;s thoughtful kindness in this, as
well as in the mental entertainment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Miss Fairfield,&rdquo; a stalwart young man
observed, &ldquo;if you knew what all this means to
us poor chaps, when we&rsquo;re miles removed from
chicken salad and ice cream, you&rsquo;d feel gratified,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Mr. Herron; I am truly glad I can
please you but more grateful to you for your
appreciation than you can possibly be for my
invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s going some!&rdquo; and the man
laughed. &ldquo;You see, Miss Fairfield, it&rsquo;s like a
glimpse of another world to a lot of us. It is
to me. Why, I come from out West, and I&rsquo;ve
never been in a home like this of yours. Oh,
I don&rsquo;t mean to say we don&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em out
West,&mdash;lots of our plutes roll in gold and all
that. But <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m of the every-day
people, and my folks are good and honest, but
plain. Not that I&rsquo;m ashamed of &rsquo;em,&mdash;Lord,
no! But I own up I&rsquo;m pleased as Punch at
this chance to be a guest in a fine house for
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not only for once, Mr. Herron,&rdquo; said
Patty, who liked the frank young fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to have you come again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to invite me,&mdash;you ought to
take a different lot every time,&mdash;but, by jingo,
if you <i>do</i> ask me, I&rsquo;m coming! You just bet
I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty laughed and passed on talking gaily to
this one and that, asking questions about things
they were interested in and conversant with,
and in all, being a charming and sympathetic
little hostess.</p>
<p>Entertaining was Patty&rsquo;s forte, and she loved
it. Moreover, she could adapt herself with
equal ease to the most aristocratic and high-bred
society or to the plainer and more commonplace
people.</p>
<p>As for these boys, she loved them, partly because
of her patriot spirit, partly from her love
of humanity, and largely because now that her
own Billee was in the war, all war people were
dear to her.</p>
<p>After supper there was still time for a dance
or two, and the guests entered into this diversion
with zest. Naturally, Patty had many
would-be partners, and she divided her dances
in an effort to please many.</p>
<p>Helen, too, was a general favourite. The
young men liked the jolly girl and pretty Bumble
laughed and joked with them, promising to
write letters to them and knit comforts for
them and to do numberless possible and impossible
things when they were back in their
camps, or wherever their duty led them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Chester Wilde was present. He was an
urgent suitor of Helen&rsquo;s, but tonight he tried
with all his energies to help Patty in the plan
she had undertaken.</p>
<p>At last, when most of the uniformed guests
had departed, Wilde noticing the tired expression
in Patty&rsquo;s eyes, led her to a cosy sofa and
advised her to rest a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you some hot bouillon,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and it will do you good. Let the rest of the
girls speed the few parting guests, and you sit
here and talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty agreed and soon they were affably chatting.
As often, their talk was of Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look pretty tonight?&rdquo; young
Wilde asked, his eyes straying to the laughing
face across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, she always does,&rdquo; agreed Patty.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a darling thing, too, Mr. Wilde, and
you mustn&rsquo;t be down-hearted because she flouts
you sometimes. I know my little old Bumble
pretty well and she&rsquo;s a great little scamp for
teasing the people she likes best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been all right, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said
the young man, moodily, &ldquo;if she had stayed in
Philadelphia. But here, there are so many
men about,&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t mean the uniformed
men,&mdash;but a lot of others who are here at your
house now and then, that I can&rsquo;t help feeling
Helen will forget me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I won&rsquo;t let her. You trust your
Aunt Patty! Why my middle name is Tact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Miss Fairfield, I know all that,
and you&rsquo;re awfully good to me, but,&mdash;oh, well,
I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;m jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you are,&rdquo; Patty laughed at him.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be any good if you weren&rsquo;t!
But you know, faint heart and all that. Don&rsquo;t
be faint-hearted, that&rsquo;s not the thing for a soldier,
at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll cheer up. You&rsquo;re a good
friend, Miss Fairfield&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, call me Patty, I&rsquo;d rather you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right and thank you. First names for
us, after this. Now don&rsquo;t think me silly, but,&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you do all you can to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To turn our Helen&rsquo;s heart in your direction?
Indeed I will, Chester, and gladly. But, take
my word for it, she likes you better than anybody
else, right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty, do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know so. Bumble,&mdash;Helen, I mean, is a
dear, but she isn&rsquo;t quite sure of her own mind.
Oh, don&rsquo;t you worry, Chester, my friend, all
will yet be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at her now. She&rsquo;s terribly taken
with that chap named Herron. See her look
at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The green-eyed monster has you in his grip,
for sure! Come on, let&rsquo;s go and see what
they&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty rose and Chester followed her to where
Helen and Philip Van Reypen were eagerly
talking to Mr. Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Herron was saying, &ldquo;to train a thousand
aviators usually means the smashing of
more than a thousand machines. Why, every
learner breaks up one or two airplanes before
he&rsquo;s a flyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Helen, her eyes big with interest.
&ldquo;And how much do these airplanes
cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about seven thousand dollars apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do! What a fearful expense for the
government!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government does have fearful expenses,
Miss Barlow,&mdash;or so I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s something awful, old man,&rdquo; put
in Van Reypen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a flyer, and
I&rsquo;ll begin training soon. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so
keen on questioning you. Do I go up in the
air at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. You begin on a machine that stays
on <i>terra firma</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t a flying machine at all,&rdquo; observed
Patty, as she and Chester joined the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is, except that it doesn&rsquo;t fly! But
one learns all the motions on it, and the controls
and the handling of winds,&mdash;and, oh, quite a
few things about it. Then later on, one goes
up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sensation it must be!&rdquo; cried Patty;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy to try it. May I go up with
you, Phil, as soon as you&rsquo;ve learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I <i>have</i> learned. You&rsquo;ll take no
chances with a novice, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;how a
machine on the ground is anything like one in
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to explain,&rdquo; returned Herron.
&ldquo;But, you see, jets of air are blown through
tubes, that simulate the currents of real air that
affect the man higher up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many for me!&rdquo; declared Helen, &ldquo;my
little two-cent brain refuses to grasp it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to see Philip perform as soon
as he knows enough to show off,&rdquo; declared
Patty. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be fun, Helen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; may we, Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;m ready to show off, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you vainy!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;Never
mind, we don&rsquo;t want to see you when you&rsquo;re
just flying on the floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really must fly from here,&rdquo; laughed Mr.
Herron. &ldquo;Such a gorgeous time, Miss Fairfield.
May I come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you would! Don&rsquo;t wait for a
special invitation,&mdash;come at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; Van Reypen said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him.
He and I will be associated, I find, in the
Aviation Training Camp, and we&rsquo;ll often run
up together,&mdash;mayn&rsquo;t we, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; as often as you can manage
to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />A SLEIGHRIDE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, Bumble?&rdquo; asked Patty, looking
in at her cousin&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know your minutes! They&rsquo;re half an
hour long each! Here,&mdash;let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty straightened Helen&rsquo;s collar, fastened
two hooks, found her gloves, tied her veil, and
performed a few more odd services for her,
and then held her fur coat for her to slip
into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like more snow, but Phil telephoned
that we&rsquo;d go anyway,&rdquo; Patty said: &ldquo;Mona and
Roger will meet us up there, and Mr. Herron
will be there too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly fine! I love a sleighride, though
goodness knows we get few enough of them
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t love it, if we get snowed under,
or snowbound at the Club.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind. We&rsquo;ll have Mona and
Roger for chaperons and we can stay till the
storm is over. Philip says the house is lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Timothy Grass Golf Club is a splendid
place, and the winter casino,&mdash;The Playbox,
they call it,&mdash;is most attractive. Oh, we&rsquo;ll
have a good time whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By way of entertaining Helen, Van Reypen
had proposed a day at the Country Club, and
his invitation was eagerly accepted. There was
snow enough on the ground to make good
sleighing, and the air was crisp, cold and clear.
Warmly garbed for their trip, the two girls
ran downstairs to find Philip awaiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray for two plucky ones!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;I thought maybe you&rsquo;d back out on account
of the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the storm?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wear rose-coloured glasses. There&rsquo;s
snow in the air, some flying, and more waiting
above, ready to come down. But not enough
to hurt two such well-befurred Esquimoses!
Come along, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The novelty of a real old-fashioned sleighride
was a great pleasure and as the fast horses
flew along, the girls exclaimed at the new delight
of such transportation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are Roger and Mona going in a sleigh,
too?&rdquo; asked Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. They&rsquo;ll come later, as
Mona just had a telegram that her father is
coming to see her today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll come to us, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Patty
asked, quickly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s our chaperon, you
know. It wouldn&rsquo;t do at all for Helen and me
to go to the Club without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she said she&rsquo;d come, as soon as her
father arrives and she gets him comfortably
welcomed. She&rsquo;s very fond of him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s an awfully nice man. What
time will we get back, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Long about five o&rsquo;clock or so. We won&rsquo;t
reach the Club before noon. Then we&rsquo;ll have
time for a game of indoor tennis or whatever
you like, of that sort. Then luncheon, and in
the afternoon there&rsquo;s time for a game of Bridge
if you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably we won&rsquo;t do anything but sit
around and chatter,&rdquo; opined Helen, who was
not fond of games. &ldquo;Mr. Herron is coming,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady. But you mustn&rsquo;t flirt with
him, or you&rsquo;ll turn his head completely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;She has done that already,&rdquo; laughed
Patty; &ldquo;Mr. Herron just sits and gazes at my
fair cousin, whenever occasion offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can any one blame him for that. Look
at the ice jam in the river! What a winter
we&rsquo;re having, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lovely winter, I think,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;I
adore cold weather, and I don&rsquo;t mind snow. I
like to feel it on my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Patty put in, &ldquo;I could do
with less of it just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white feathers were flying briskly through
the air, and Patty cuddled her face deep into
her high fur collar. She was not quite so fond
of the elements as Helen, and felt the cold
more.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The snow is falling all around,</p>
<p class="t">It&rsquo;s falling here and there;</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s falling through the atmosphere</p>
<p class="t">And also through the air.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Helen chanted the lines to an accompaniment
of dashing the flakes from her veiled face.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The snow is falling all around,</p>
<p class="t">And wonder fills my cup,</p>
<p class="t0">Whether, when it is all snowed down</p>
<p class="t">We won&rsquo;t be all snowed up!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Patty sang her parody, in a high, clear voice,
and then returned to her depths of collar.</p>
<p>Then Philip took up the game:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The snow is falling all around,</p>
<p class="t">But you girls needn&rsquo;t fret;</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ll soon arrive where we are bound,</p>
<p class="t">And you&rsquo;ll get warm,&mdash;you bet!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely, Phil!&rdquo; murmured Patty, &ldquo;you do
sing like a cherub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose my coloratura is a little
off, but every time I open my mouth the snow
snows in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to make liquid notes,&rdquo; said Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now! If you&rsquo;re going to talk like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only sing of Greenland&rsquo;s Icy Mountains,&rdquo;
Helen declared, and just then they came
in sight of the Club house.</p>
<p>A huge structure it was, in a large park, and
surrounded by trees and gardens. In summer
it was a beautiful spot, but in winter some
thought it even more so. The Golf Links
showed great stretches of white and the bare
black limbs of the tall trees made a picturesque
foreground. The house itself, with glassed-in
veranda and storm doors, looked like a haven
of refuge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The girls ran inside, and were greeted by the
sound of crackling flames in a great fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think a Club is the nicest place!&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen, as she sat down on a fireside
settle. &ldquo;And this one has such a cheery, hospitable
atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Patty, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see many
people around. Aren&rsquo;t there very few, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather so. But it&rsquo;s an uncertain quantity,
you know. Some days the place is crowded,
and again nearly empty. It&rsquo;s always so in a
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mona?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come soon. I told you she&rsquo;d be late.
Don&rsquo;t fuss, Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Patty smiled at him.</p>
<p>But she was anxious, for Patty was conservative
by nature, and a close observer of the conventions.
She was unacquainted at this Club,
and if Mona shouldn&rsquo;t come, she felt a grave
uncertainty as to what she could do. She and
Helen couldn&rsquo;t stay the day there without
Mona, and the storm was gaining in force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d telephone,&rdquo; she said to Van
Reypen, &ldquo;and see if they&rsquo;ve started.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my liege lady, I will. Just wait
a minute, till I get this numbness from my
digits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let him get warm, Patty,&rdquo; Helen remonstrated;
&ldquo;the poor man is almost frozen, and
you send him to telephone about nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed it isn&rsquo;t nothing! If for any reason
Mona doesn&rsquo;t come, we must go right home,
Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t cross the bridge before you come
to it. At least, let me have a look around. I
want to see that sun-parlour and that other
palmy nook, over there! Oh, I think this the
most fascinating place I ever saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> charming. And I&rsquo;m glad to be here,
but I want things right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty, you&rsquo;re not unlike Friend Hamlet.
You&rsquo;re always setting the world right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Phil, but you don&rsquo;t stop to think.
You know we two girls can&rsquo;t stay here without
Mona or some married woman as a chaperon.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you think; that&rsquo;s society&rsquo;s
law and must be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s pink cheeks took on an added flush
and her blue eyes grew violet, as they did when
she was very much in earnest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Patty; I know, dear. Why, I&rsquo;m as
well acquainted with the conventions as you
are. Do you suppose I want you to do anything
not absolutely correct? But the Farringtons
will come directly. They started later
than we did, and the increasing depth of snow
may make them longer on the road. But
they&rsquo;re sure to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s air of conviction reassured Patty, and
she turned to the great blazing fire again, with
a sigh of contentment. There were two or
three Club members about, but save for those
and the liveried footmen here and there, the
place was deserted.</p>
<p>Helen, thoroughly warm, jumped from her
seat and went about looking at the various
attractive rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful library!&rdquo; she said, returning
from her tour of investigation; &ldquo;I could be
happy there all day, just looking at the picture
papers and books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So could I,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;if we had
somebody with us. Why didn&rsquo;t we bring
Nan? That would have made everything all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mona&rsquo;s sure to come soon,&rdquo; comforted
Helen. &ldquo;Let up, Patty, you make me tired
with your fussing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Good-naturedly, Patty &ldquo;let up&rdquo; and said no
more for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, people!&rdquo; called a cheery voice,
and a big figure in uniform came swinging
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Herron!&rdquo; cried Helen, running forward
to greet him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came!
Did you come in your airship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could have done so, for the going
on the ground is something awful. This is sure
one fierce storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty went over and lifted a curtain to look
out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-ee!&rdquo; she cried out, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s coming down
thicker&rsquo;n ever! How can Mona get here?
They&rsquo;ll be snowbound, half way here! Phil,
please go and telephone; I <i>must</i> know if they&rsquo;ve
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go quick,&rdquo; laughed Herron, &ldquo;before
the telephone wires are down. It&rsquo;s that wet,
heavy snow that weighs the wires down fearfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Phil started for the telephone
booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get here,&rdquo; opined Bumble; &ldquo;you
worry over nothing, Patty Pink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t get here unless they started some
time ago,&rdquo; Herron said; &ldquo;the roads are getting
worse every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger will manage somehow,&rdquo; Helen went
on. &ldquo;I know him of old,&mdash;and he isn&rsquo;t to be
baulked by a few flakes of snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Phil returned looking serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not coming,&rdquo; he announced, briefly,
meeting Patty&rsquo;s startled eyes squarely, but
apologetically. &ldquo;Not on account of the storm,
but because Mona&rsquo;s father arrived, and he isn&rsquo;t
well and Mona won&rsquo;t leave him. She says to
tell you she&rsquo;s awfully sorry, but it seems her
father is really pretty ill, and she can&rsquo;t get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must go right home,&rdquo; said Patty,
very decidedly. &ldquo;You know yourself, Phil, we
two girls can&rsquo;t stay here without Mona&mdash;or
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know it, Patty. Give me a
minute to think. I hate to go home and give
up our nice day here. Maybe we can fix it.
I&rsquo;ll go and see the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be all right, Phil,&rdquo; and
Patty&rsquo;s lovely face broke into a smile. &ldquo;If
she&rsquo;s a nice motherly or auntly old lady,
she&rsquo;d do admirably! Go and see about it,
do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; said Herron, &ldquo;maybe I can fix
it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone a long time, but he came back
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The housekeeper isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s gone off for a few days&rsquo; holiday. Her
present substitute is her daughter, a girl
younger than you girls are. Also there&rsquo;s nobody
who can play chaperon to a pair of lone,
lorn damsels but one elderly specimen, who is
by way of being a pastry-cook or something like
that. However,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
if she&rsquo;s a pastry-cook or a laundress if she only
satisfies Patty&rsquo;s insane desire for a chaperon!
Will she come? Will she stay by us till we
go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come to luncheon with us,&rdquo; said
Herron, &ldquo;and after that I think we&rsquo;d better
start for home. The snow is getting deeper,
and though it looks as if the sun might break
through the clouds any minute,&mdash;yet it may not,
and the drifts are high, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a calamity howler!&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, and we&rsquo;re safe and warm, and
the pie lady will do quite well for a chaperon,
and anybody who grumbles now, is a wet
blanket and a pessimist and a catamaran! So,
there, now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Patty laughed; &ldquo;let me see the
elderly dame, and if she passes muster, I&rsquo;ll
stop growling like a bear and be so nice and
amiable you won&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you when you&rsquo;re anything but
amiable!&rdquo; declared Philip; &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your
friend, Herron? Trot her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dressing,&rdquo; Herron returned. &ldquo;She
said she must doll up to meet the young
ladies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she use that expression?&rdquo; asked Patty,
severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! That&rsquo;s mine. She said she&rsquo;d
put on her other gown,&mdash;or something like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide till I see her,&rdquo; Patty said;
&ldquo;if she&rsquo;s really all right, we&rsquo;ll stay. If not,
you must take us right home, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your word is my law. When Patty says
go, we all goeth! Whew! how it snows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the snow,&rdquo; urged Herron; &ldquo;no
matter what the weather when we four get together!
Now, what can we do in the way of
high jinks? Anybody want to try the swimming
pool?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; and Bumble shivered at
the thought. &ldquo;Can we dance anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till after lunch,&rdquo; said Patty. &ldquo;Dancing
in the morning has gone out. Besides, it&rsquo;s
nearly lunch time now. Let&rsquo;s knit for a while,&mdash;and
not go jumping about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dormouse, Patty. You&rsquo;d rather
nod over your knitting needles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t nod over them! I knit faster than
you do! Come on, start at the beginning of
your needle, and I&rsquo;ll race you for five rows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls settled themselves comfortably by
the big fire, and opened their knitting bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I call this fine!&rdquo; declared Herron;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s nicer than to have you girls sit and
knit and we men sit and look at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing nicer to look at,&rdquo; said
Helen complacently, &ldquo;on that we&rsquo;re all agreed.
Now, make yourselves entertaining, and we&rsquo;ll
call it square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretty Helen&rsquo;s gay face bent over her khaki-coloured
wool, and her needles clicked bravely
in an effort to knit faster than Patty. And she
did, but it was only a spurt. She dropped a
stitch, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Hold on, Patty, no fair
your knitting when I&rsquo;m picking up this stitch!
You wait now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so; a dropped stitch in time loses nine!
Come on, hare, catch up with this old tortoise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calmly, Patty proceeded with her steadily-moving
needles, and again Helen made an
hysterical burst of speed and caught up as to
distance. But her wool snarled somehow, and
Herron, trying to help her, made it worse, and
the four hands that tried to untangle it only
drew it into tighter knots.</p>
<p>Helen burst out laughing, and awarded Patty
the palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always so,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;I fly
at a thing and tumble all over myself, and accomplish
just about nothing. Patty goes about
it leisurely, and comes in at the last, easily
winner, and with a big lot of work to her
credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me, angel child,&rdquo; Patty smiled.
&ldquo;I knit because I love to knit, and I get a lot
done, because I don&rsquo;t try to beat everybody
else. There, how&rsquo;s that for a helmet? I
rather guess some one of Our Boys will be glad
to wear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind myself,&rdquo; suggested Herron,
timidly, and Patty replied at once, &ldquo;Then you
shall have it! I&rsquo;ll fit it to your head now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want mine, Philip?&rdquo; asked Helen, as
she industriously &ldquo;picked back&rdquo; a few stitches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I may be allowed to wear out two or
three others while yours is in process of
construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot rudeness! To think I should live to
hear such! Well, just for that I&rsquo;ll put all the
knots inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make me think of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll put a note in it,&mdash;that&rsquo;s often
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note of thanks. If the girls did that, it
would save many a poor soldier a lot of
trouble! He could just sign it and send it
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unsentimental and ungrateful you are!
Why, the boys just love to get notes in their
socks and sweaters and then they love to answer
them. It&rsquo;s no hardship, I can tell you! I&rsquo;ve
had the notes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have had very many,&mdash;you&rsquo;re too
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen gave him a laughing scowl at this fresh
fling at her slow progress and then she threw
down her knitting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do any more, now. I&rsquo;ve come to the
place to cast on, and I forget how many, and I
left my paper of directions at home, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, come with me, and let&rsquo;s go and
hurry up our chaperon lady,&rdquo; said Herron,
rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; urged Patty, who was in nervous
anxiety about that matter.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Patty&rsquo;s in a pucker!&rdquo; sang Helen, &ldquo;like little Tommy Tucker!</p>
<p class="t">What shall she eat? War bread and butter!</p>
<p class="t0">How shall she eat it, without a chaperon?</p>
<p class="t">Put her in a padded cell and let her eat alone!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s foolishness never annoyed Patty, and
so she bade the two ambassadors proceed with
their errand and Helen and Mr. Herron went
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, Patty,&rdquo; said Philip, after the
others had left the room, &ldquo;it will be all right.
The snow is lighter now; and we&rsquo;ll go home
directly after luncheon. I don&rsquo;t want you to
be disturbed, and I do understand,&mdash;you know
I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; Patty replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />A QUEER CHAPERON</h2>
<p>When Mrs. Doremus was introduced,
Patty&rsquo;s thoughts ran somewhat like
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice old lady; apple-cheeked, white-haired
and quiet-mannered. A little shy, but well-bred
and kindly. Old-fashioned dress,&mdash;or, rather
it looks so, because it&rsquo;s so long. Why, it almost
touches the floor. But, she&rsquo;s all right,
and her big, tortoise-rimmed glasses give her
quite an air of distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen, on the other hand, paid little attention
to the chaperon, save to greet her pleasantly
and thank her for her presence.</p>
<p>The five went to the Club dining-room for
luncheon. There were a few others at various
tables, but no one with whom the girls were
acquainted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly brimming with happiness,&rdquo; Helen
announced; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always longed to be at a big
country club in winter, and I&rsquo;ve never achieved
it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s winter, all right,&rdquo; said Herron, looking
out at the steady snowfall. &ldquo;But the palms
and flowers make this seem like an oasis of
summer, screened in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful pretty room,&rdquo; and Helen looked
round contentedly, as she finished her grape
fruit. &ldquo;And of a just-right temperature. I&rsquo;d
like to stay here a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>may</i> get your wish,&rdquo; and Mrs. Doremus
smiled at her, &ldquo;if this snow keeps on, I don&rsquo;t
see how you <i>can</i> go back to the city today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; cried Patty, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say
such a thing! Remember, Phil, when we were
snowbound at that queer old house in the
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I remember! Why, we had the time
of our sweet young life up there! I never ate
such chicken pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. And those two quaint old ladies
were a whole show themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this storm isn&rsquo;t going to be so very
bad,&rdquo; Herron said; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s lessening now.
We&rsquo;ll go down this afternoon, all right, all
right. I think, Miss Fairfield, you&rsquo;re anxious
to get a letter from somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Patty blushed prettily. &ldquo;Well, perhaps I am.
I came away before mailtime, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had one yesterday,&rdquo; Helen told, &ldquo;a
big, fat one! That ought to last you for a
while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was yesterday! I want today&rsquo;s
bulletin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! A letter every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Herron, that&rsquo;s the way engaged
people keep alive, when separated by this cruel
war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind letters now,&rdquo; begged Van Reypen,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s forget everybody who isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you engaged to a soldier, my
child?&rdquo; Mrs. Doremus asked of Patty. The
old lady had a low, gentle voice, and though she
said little, she had a delightful manner and a
smile that betokened a keen sense of humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Captain Farnsworth; but he isn&rsquo;t
exactly a soldier. I mean, he doesn&rsquo;t expect to
fight. He is an expert mining engineer, and
his country seems to find a lot of work for him,
without sending him to the front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Farnsworth, the Westerner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not at all. But I saw something about
him in the paper,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did! Oh, what was it? I&rsquo;m interested,
of course, in anything pertaining to him
or his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to remember; I can&rsquo;t exactly
place it; but I recollect seeing his name. And
are you, too, engaged to an enlisted man, Miss
Barlow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but I hope to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right! Next to serving one&rsquo;s country,
is being the helpmeet of one who does. Have
you,&mdash;ah,&mdash;selected&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my selective draft hasn&rsquo;t yet been
made,&rdquo; and Bumble&rsquo;s jolly little face smiled
broadly; &ldquo;you see, there are so many fascinating
men in the service,&mdash;indeed, &rsquo;most any man
is fascinating in uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wear uniform,&rdquo; said Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but lots of others do, too, and every
time I meet a new one I lose my heart to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear me you&rsquo;re a sad coquette, Miss Barlow,&rdquo;
and the chaperon beamed on her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am a coquette,&rdquo; Helen admitted, calmly,
&ldquo;but not at all a sad one! Indeed, I&rsquo;m as
merry as a grig. Why, I get letters from lots
of the boys in camp. Miss Fairfield is content
with only one correspondent, while I have a
dozen! I just adore to get their letters, and
to send them things, and to write to them. The
war is terrible, but it does give one <i>some</i> new
and pleasant experiences. And I don&rsquo;t feel it
my duty to lament all the time. My mission
is cheering people up and cheering soldiers
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no doubt you&rsquo;re a grand success at
it, too. And some day you&rsquo;ll decide to send all
your letters to the same address, as Miss Fairfield
does. Where is Mr. Farnsworth now,
may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Washington,&rdquo; Patty replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he coming to New York soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Patty spoke a
little coldly, for Bill had cautioned her over
and over again, never on any account to tell
any one of his plans or to repeat anything he
might write, which concerned military matters
or might give war information of any sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you must long to know! I don&rsquo;t mean
definitely, of course, but can&rsquo;t you hope to see
him soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An insistent tone in Mrs. Doremus&rsquo; voice
caused Patty to look up quickly, and she saw
the keen eyes regarding her intently through
the big glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>But though the old lady&rsquo;s interest might have
been a bit strong for such short acquaintance,
Patty was too polite to resent that, and she
laughed and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to tell, with
a soldier boy. One can only hope,&mdash;one may
not expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a philosophical attitude, my dear, and
does you credit. Is Captain Farnsworth in the
Engineers&rsquo; Camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Patty, this time with decided
shortness; &ldquo;how very nice this sweetbread is!
I&rsquo;ve always been so fond of them. But one
oughtn&rsquo;t to serve them on a sweetless day,
ought one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty, what a silly joke!&rdquo; chided Helen.
&ldquo;You mean a meatless day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both ought to be barred,&rdquo; smiled Patty;
&ldquo;also they ought not to be served on a breadless
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if they wouldn&rsquo;t be served at all
any more,&rdquo; said Herron; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s gather these
sweetbreads while we may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps the war will soon be over, and
then we can eat what we like,&rdquo; Helen suggested.
&ldquo;It will be over soon, you know, because of
the eagles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a true omen. You know down at
Beverly, New Jersey, long ago,&mdash;oh, during
the Revolution,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a real honest-to-goodness, once-upon-a-time
story?&rdquo; asked Van Reypen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I move we move to the sun-parlour,
and have our coffee there. We&rsquo;ll take our
coffee,&mdash;sugarless, if Patty says so,&mdash;and then
we can hear the story, and then we must see
about going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Patty agreed. &ldquo;Will you join us in
this desperate scheme, Mrs. Doremus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you must, if you&rsquo;re busy,&rdquo;
interposed Herron. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the ladies
will excuse you if you have duties to attend
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned the chaperon, calmly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to have the coffee and the story,
if I am permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Helen, jumping up, &ldquo;come
along, Mrs. Doremus; you and I will pick out
the sunniest spot. Philip, bring Patty; and
Mr. Herron, will you order the coffee served
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen slipped her arm through that of the
grey-haired lady, and they walked away together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Philip detained Patty as she was about to
follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer old party,&rdquo; he said, very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Mrs. Doremus? I rather like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t! Be careful what you say
before her, and we must get away as soon as
we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Phil, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing particular. Only, don&rsquo;t let Helen
persuade you to stay all the afternoon. It&rsquo;s
nearly three now, and we must get away by
four, at latest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Phil, but I never knew you to look
so scared. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuss, Patty; go ahead and join the
crowd; but remember not to answer personal
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty wondered what had come over Philip&rsquo;s
mind, but she thought no more about it, rather
glad than otherwise, that he was determined to
go home so early.</p>
<p>They crossed the big foyer, and across a chair
there, was a fur stole of Patty&rsquo;s which she had
left there in case of need while in the house.
She picked it up, exclaiming: &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s my
fur! I might have forgotten it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lend it to me, won&rsquo;t you, if you&rsquo;re not wearing
it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Doremus. &ldquo;I feel a bit
chilly,&mdash;but, perhaps you do too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I&rsquo;m warm as toast. Use it, by all
means. Let me put it round you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty draped the long stole round the shivering
shoulders, and Mrs. Doremus said, apologetically,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really cold, but I take precaution
for fear of rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Patty acquiesced, and then the
coffee tray was brought and Patty did the
honours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sugar?&rdquo; she asked of the chaperon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, please; and may I be excused for a few
moments? I&rsquo;ve just thought of an order I
meant to give, and the gaiety of our little
party made me forget it. I don&rsquo;t mind if my
coffee gets a little cool,&mdash;I like it better so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Doremus went off toward the housekeeping
quarters, and the others made merry
over their coffee cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you want to start right off,
Philip,&rdquo; Helen demurred. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s going
to stop snowing just about now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, my child?&rdquo; said Van Reypen,
serenely; &ldquo;be that as it may, we stand not on
the order of our going, but go at once,&mdash;instanter,&mdash;immejit,&mdash;all-in-a-hurry,&mdash;so
soon as your coffee is despatched.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; and Helen pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours not to put that direct question.
Yours not to make remarks. Yours but to get
into your befurments and hie away to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure we can make it,&rdquo; said
Herron, pouring himself another cup of the
rich brown beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can,&rdquo; and the cheery voice of
Mrs. Doremus sounded in the doorway.
&ldquo;This my cup? Fine! I like it a lot better
not so blooming hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty looked up suddenly, for the lapse into
slang made her think that the pastry cook had
been on her guard at lunch time, and had now
fallen back to what must be her usual diction.</p>
<p>The old lady was smiling, and as she took her
cup and sat down near the girls, Patty felt a
sudden aversion.</p>
<p>But she reproached herself for such a feeling
toward one who had not only been kind and
polite but had helped them out of a real predicament.</p>
<p>By way of salving her conscience, she assumed
a kinder manner, and gently readjusted the fur
stole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a dear girl you are!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Doremus, in a burst of admiration. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
wonder Little Billee loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty stared at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do know Captain Farnsworth, then!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;or how would you know he is
called that by his intimate friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chaperon looked confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have heard you call him that since
you&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you haven&rsquo;t! I never speak of him
that way to strangers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Patty, don&rsquo;t get wrathy!&rdquo; said
Philip, smiling at the lifted chin and tossed
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Patty realised her own
foolishness. &ldquo;Forgive me, Mrs. Doremus, I
suppose I&rsquo;m a silly young thing. But you see,
I&rsquo;ve never been engaged before and I&rsquo;m a little
fussy about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, young folks ought to be
like that. My, when I was engaged, I flew off
my head if anybody so much as looked at my
young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been so very long ago,&rdquo;
smiled Patty, who had suddenly come to the
conclusion that Mrs. Doremus was not so very
old, and was, doubtless, prematurely grey-haired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, many and many a year. But
memory is still green, and the sight of young
lovers makes my mind turn back, as to a well-remembered
page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, Patty caught the strange inflection, as
if Mrs. Doremus&rsquo; words were not quite sincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, girls,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ve finished
your coffee, let&rsquo;s be thinking about
starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go!&rdquo; protested Helen; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
perfectly lovely here, and we can just as well
stay an hour longer as not. Can&rsquo;t we, Mr.
Herron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned, yes. But, unless
you start soon, you may find the roads impassable,
and be obliged to remain here over
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve the idea!&rdquo; Helen cried, &ldquo;you men
go back to town, and leave us girls here to stay
the night with Mrs. Doremus! I do think that
would be fine! You&rsquo;d take care of us, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her bright, coaxing face to the
apple-cheeked old lady, with mute appeal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>To her surprise, Mrs. Doremus was suddenly
afflicted with a hard coughing spell. She
choked and nearly strangled, growing red in
the face, and gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Herron jumped up and quickly led her from
the room, with some hasty words about fresh
air.</p>
<p>Van Reypen looked angry and a bit puzzled,
but Patty was deeply concerned for the old
lady&rsquo;s comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, too,&rdquo; she exclaimed, rising,
&ldquo;she needs me,&mdash;not Mr. Herron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Patty,&rdquo; Philip ordered, somewhat
gruffly. &ldquo;Stay where you are. There are
plenty of women servants to look after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s so nice, Phil! Too nice to have
only servants&rsquo; care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, I tell you. You can&rsquo;t go to her.
Remember, Patty, you&rsquo;re not a member of this
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; and Patty sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Herron, returning; &ldquo;she
just choked a little, that&rsquo;s all. And she has
chronic throat trouble, so it rather strangled
her. She sends you her adieux, and begs to
be excused from further appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;she mustn&rsquo;t
think of returning. And we&rsquo;re going now, anyhow.
Stop your nonsense, Helen, and come,
let&rsquo;s get our coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wanna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, you old goose, but you
must.&rdquo; Patty took her cousin&rsquo;s arm and led
her off to the cloak-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be goody-girl,&rdquo; Herron called after her,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll stop at any place you like for afternoon
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you?&rdquo; and Helen brightened up
suddenly. &ldquo;At the Sunset Tea-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wherever you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sleigh came to the door,&mdash;horses prancing,
bells jingling, and the driver cracking his
whip, in true old-time style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait a minute,&rdquo; Patty cried, as they
were about to get in, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s my stole? Mrs.
Doremus still has it! I&rsquo;m so glad I remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; volunteered Herron. &ldquo;You
others wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone so long that Philip suggested
Mrs. Doremus had decamped with the fur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it valuable, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is, it&rsquo;s a perfectly good piece of
kolinski.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better make up your mind to order another.
Something tells me you&rsquo;ll never see that
particular animal again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly, Phil, of course I will. They
don&rsquo;t have kleptomaniacs in a Club like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People of acquisitive tendencies are to be
found everywhere. However, here comes
Herron with the pelt, but he looks as if he&rsquo;d
had to fight for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, Herron appeared, greatly
ruffled. His face was red, his eyes glowering,
and his whole aspect that of a man who has
been through a war of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, with a very evident effort
to seem at ease, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your fur cape,&mdash;or
whatever you call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stole,&rdquo; corrected Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Herron. &ldquo;Mrs.
Doremus had mislaid it, in her excitement, and
couldn&rsquo;t remember for the moment where it
was. But she found it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the fur round Patty&rsquo;s neck, and assisted
her into the sleigh in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; that astute young woman
remarked to herself. &ldquo;I must find out about it,&mdash;that
is, if it concerns me, and I pretty much
think it does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>But she was far too canny to ask questions of
Herron then. She chatted gaily and smiled
brightly, telling herself the while, that there
could be nothing really wrong.</p>
<p>The snow had almost ceased falling, and before
they had gone more than a mile, the sun
came straggling through the clouds, as it sometimes
does when anxious to finish off a snowstorm
quickly.</p>
<p>And Helen was delighted, for she knew that
meant they would stop at her favourite tea-room,
and she could have the chocolate and
sweet cakes which were her beloved though
&ldquo;forbidden fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />IN THE TEA-ROOM</h2>
<p>The Sunset Tea-room did not belie its
name. The draperies and decorations
were of true sunset tints,&mdash;gold and
amber, with glints of red, and all most harmonious
and effective.</p>
<p>The quartette found a pleasant table, where
the shaded lights cast a soft glow over the
pretty appointments, and Helen picked up the
menu card with pleased anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just incorrigible, Bumble!&rdquo; laughed
Patty; &ldquo;you promised me you&rsquo;d cut out sweet
things for afternoon tea, yet I see you
voraciously devouring the cake list!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Patsy Poppet, but today is an
exception,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day isn&rsquo;t? All right, girlie, but like
Lady Jane in the play &lsquo;there will be too much
of you in the coming by-and-by!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be too much of a good thing!&rdquo;
said Herron, gaily, &ldquo;so go ahead, Miss Barlow,
choose all the puff paste and whipped
cream you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did that, I&rsquo;d order the whole card,&rdquo;
Helen returned, &ldquo;and that wouldn&rsquo;t do at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the story of the little pickaninny,&rdquo; put
in Van Reypen; &ldquo;they said he was ill from eating
too much watermelon. And a neighbour
said, &lsquo;Law sakes! Dey ain&rsquo;t no such t&rsquo;ing as
too much watermillion!&rsquo; and the reply was,
&rsquo;Den dere wasn&rsquo;t enough boy!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly,&rdquo; and Helen smiled; &ldquo;there
aren&rsquo;t too many kinds of cakes here,&mdash;but there
isn&rsquo;t quite enough me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after some careful consideration, she
selected the most irresistible dainties, and the
others also made their choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told us the &lsquo;Eagle&rsquo; story,&rdquo;
Herron reminded, as they waited for their
order to be served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;what was it,
Helen? Didn&rsquo;t you say it had to do with the
end of the war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you look at it. Here&rsquo;s the tale.
You see, down at Beverly, just before the close
of the Revolution, there appeared a few
eagles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bald?&rdquo; inquired Phil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno if they were bald or long-haired or
blonde,&mdash;but they were eagles,&mdash;real, live
American eagles. And they had never been
seen in that locality before. Well, their appearance
heralded the end of the Revolution,&mdash;and
immediately it ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Philip, a little ironically; &ldquo;it
reminds me of the slave who called out, &lsquo;Oh,
King live forever!&rsquo; and <i>immediately</i> the King
lived forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that&rsquo;s a better story
than mine,&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll proceed
with mine, as, if I don&rsquo;t, I may not get it done
before my cakies come. Well, the Revolution
ended, and no eagles were seen any more at all,
in or near Beverly. Until,&mdash;near the close of
the Civil War, those same eagles appeared in
Beverly again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they were the same ones? Pretty old
birds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, eagles live thousands of years! That&rsquo;s
<i>nothing</i> for an eagle! Anyway, the eagles
came, and the Civil War soon came to its
close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then for the point of this tale,&rdquo; said
Herron. &ldquo;Has friend eagle showed up of
late?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has!&rdquo; cried Helen triumphantly; &ldquo;several
eagles were seen there last week! Now, <i>I</i>
believe this war will soon end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American eagle is a war-ender, all
right!&rdquo; declared Phil, &ldquo;and I hope to goodness,
Helen, your pet scheme works out. Just
how long after the eagles&rsquo; arrival is peace declared?
Usually, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say. Nor do I swear to the
truth of the story. But I tell the tale as &rsquo;twas
told to me, and you can take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; said Patty, promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
wee bit superstitious, and I like to think of the
eagles appearing as a harbinger of hope of
peace,&mdash;like the Ark dove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t do any harm to believe it,&rdquo; and
Philip smiled at her; &ldquo;and it may do good. If
you believed in a thing I&rsquo;m sure it would make
me do so, too, and if a lot of us believe, it
might help to make it come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll all believe,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m sure glad to be the means,&mdash;in a small way,&mdash;of
helping my country toward peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can scarcely call it <i>more</i> than a small
way,&rdquo; Herron said, mock-judicially, &ldquo;and yet
it&rsquo;s as much as many of us do. Even if we&rsquo;re
willing, we can&rsquo;t perform. I&rsquo;m ready to fly to
the ends of the earth for my old Uncle Sam,
but I have to await orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t help feeling glad that you do,&rdquo;
interposed Helen. &ldquo;What would us girls do
without you boys to play with? To be sure,
we&rsquo;ll give you up</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ready! Fire!&rsquo; and you fire away,</p>
<p class="t0">And fight &rsquo;em to a finish for the U. S. A.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For us, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ready! Fly!&rsquo; and we fly away,&rdquo;
and Philip looked eager at the thought. &ldquo;I
hate to leave my ain fireside, and that of
friends and fellow citizens, but there is an
urge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like Sam Blaney!&rdquo; and Patty
laughed. &ldquo;He was always talking about the
Cosmic Urge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t in it with the Urge of the Flag.
Oh, you girls don&rsquo;t know the <i>thrill</i> of feeling
that you can be of real help,&mdash;however small
or insignificant help it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty gave Phil an admiring glance. She
liked this sort of talk and though she knew of
his patriotism, she had rarely heard him express
it so strongly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your cakaroons!&rdquo; cried Herron, as
the tray appeared, and the tea and chocolate
were served to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, no war talk, for the moment,&rdquo; begged
Helen. &ldquo;It does interfere with my enjoyment
of my frugal fare, to get stirred up, even
by patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about our visit at the Club,&rdquo; said
Patty, suddenly. &ldquo;Did it strike any of you
that Mrs. Doremus was a very strange
person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it!&rdquo; said Philip, with emphasis.
&ldquo;Well, <i>rather</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo; asked Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, she was no lady,&rdquo; Van
Reypen asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean?&rdquo; pursued Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little harsh,&rdquo; Patty demurred,
&ldquo;but she certainly acted queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you care?&rdquo; Herron demanded,
&ldquo;she served the purpose of chaperon, when no
one else was there to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. The principal thing I noticed
that seemed strange was that she didn&rsquo;t knit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness gracious! I never thought of
that!&rdquo; exclaimed Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Patty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;At least, she could have made a stab at it,
which is what most women do. Oh, you
needn&rsquo;t laugh! I&rsquo;ve observed them! They
spend more time holding their work off and
looking at it, or counting stitches, or picking
back&mdash;whatever that is!&mdash;or correcting mistakes,
or, just patting and pinching the thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr. Herron,&rdquo; and Patty
laughed at his graphic description, which was
greatly aided by his dramatic imitation of a
nervous knitter. &ldquo;But Mrs. Doremus didn&rsquo;t
even do that. Nor did she say anything about
it,&mdash;which was queer, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was queer,&rdquo; agreed Helen, &ldquo;though
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it before. Oh, Patty!
This cream cake is a <i>dream</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dream cake?&rdquo; suggested Philip, &ldquo;a cream
cake dream cake,&mdash;well, what I noticed especially
about our friend and benefactor, was her
shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herron looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lady would wear shoes like those!&rdquo; Van
Reypen asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;her dress
was so long. Queer, to have such very long
skirts, nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No lady would wear such a long skirt,&rdquo; Van
Reypen went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil, don&rsquo;t be so critical,&rdquo; and Patty
shook her head at him. &ldquo;Mrs. Doremus
wasn&rsquo;t fashionable, I know, nor even very well
posted as to a chaperon&rsquo;s duties, but she was
kind, and she filled what I think is known as a
long-felt want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me something you haven&rsquo;t told me,
Patty,&rdquo; and Helen looked reproachfully at her
cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says your Big Bill is coming to New
York in February.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did! A lot she knows about it! She&rsquo;s
a meddlesome Matty,&mdash;I think! And, besides,
he isn&rsquo;t,&mdash;&rsquo;cause why? &rsquo;cause if he had
been he would have told his little Patty
person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d she know?&rdquo; asked Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. She may have heard some rumours
or had inside information from somebody. I
thought you&rsquo;d be glad to hear it, Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, if it&rsquo;s true. But, I never believe good
news, till I&rsquo;m pretty positive. It saves disappointment,
lots of times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little philosopher!&rdquo; and Van Reypen gave
her a sympathetic glance. &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if that news were true, for I saw
something in the paper this morning that
looked like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get home, I&rsquo;ll have a letter,&rdquo; and
Patty blushed a little, &ldquo;and I rather guess I&rsquo;ll
be told, if there&rsquo;s anything to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; said Herron. &ldquo;Also,
I&rsquo;d not be surprised if Miss Fairfield knows
more herself than she tells! These letters from
Washington to personal friends are not to be
read aloud in the market-place,&mdash;for more
reasons than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty looked conscious, but said nothing.
Indeed, it was true that Farnsworth often wrote
bits of comment on subjects that Patty knew
must not be talked over nor his information
divulged. And so, she preserved a scrupulous
secrecy regarding any war news her letters
might hold.</p>
<p>Also, once in a while, Farnsworth sent Patty
a little letter, sealed and enclosed in another.
This he sometimes asked her not to open until
a certain time, or he asked her to mail it in
New York, for secret reasons.</p>
<p>All of these matters Patty attended to with
punctilious care and she loved to think that she
was helping her Little Billee and also her
country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t read one&rsquo;s love letters aloud,&mdash;naturally!&rdquo;
and Patty looked down and
blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;I should
say <i>not</i>! And especially yours! Oh, I know!
You&rsquo;ve read bits to me now and then, and if
what you <i>omit</i> is any more&mdash;ahem&mdash;well,
turtle-dovish than what you <i>do</i> read, and I&rsquo;ve
no doubt it <i>is</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Patty returned, with unmoved equanimity.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being engaged if
one may not be what you call turtle-dovey!
I&rsquo;m not a bit embarrassed about it. But for
my part, I think Mrs. Doremus was decidedly
over-curious and forward about me and my
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unladylike,&rdquo; put in Van Reypen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you harp on that word!&rdquo; exclaimed
Patty. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was so much that, as
a lack of good breeding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Patty, didn&rsquo;t you catch on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch on to what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that Mrs. Doremus was no lady,&mdash;because,&mdash;she
was a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;She sure was! And I&rsquo;d like an explanation,
Herron. I thought I&rsquo;d let the matter pass
until I could see you alone, but I think it&rsquo;s
better to have it out here and now. You
brought that person to us, you fixed up the
matter, now tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Herron burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own up!&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I did it! Alone
I did it! Oh, it <i>was</i> a joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty looked puzzled. &ldquo;A man?&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;masquerading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that, dear lady,&rdquo; and Herron laughed
afresh. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it! There was no
woman on the premises save the housekeeper&rsquo;s
daughter, who was only a girl of fifteen or so.
There was no way to keep you girls there for
luncheon except by providing a chaperon. So,&mdash;I
did my best. Don&rsquo;t look so shocked. It
was only a harmless jest. Surely, the quondam
chaperon was in no way objectionable;
and, as Miss Fairfield admits, she&mdash;or he&mdash;filled
a long-felt want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who was she&mdash;or he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Club attendants. He&rsquo;s on the
house force, sort of manager of the heating and
electricity departments. Well, I was put to it,
as you know, and I was asking him what to do,
and he suggested,&mdash;or to be accurate, he fell
in with my suggestion,&mdash;that he slip into one of
the housekeeper&rsquo;s gowns and play &rsquo;Charley&rsquo;s
Aunt.&rsquo; So he did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;Charley&rsquo;s Aunt&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an old play, all college chaps know,
where a young man played chaperon just as
Munson did today. Not going to be mad
about it, are you, Miss Fairfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;I think
it&rsquo;s a great joke! And, as you say, we couldn&rsquo;t
have stayed there, otherwise! Oh, Patty,
don&rsquo;t get on your Puritanic high horse! It
was only a regard for a convention, anyway,
and the convention was regarded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen went off in peals of laughter at the
reminiscence of the so-called chaperon. &ldquo;No
wonder he wore a long skirt! To cover up his
feet,&mdash;of course! And his white wig! Oh, it
was perfect! Where did he get a wig so
handy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in a little room where a lot of things
are, left, I believe, from some theatrical jinks.
Anyway, he said he could make up perfectly,&mdash;and
he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he did! I think he was fine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was fine, Helen, as a masquerader,&rdquo; said
Patty, slowly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it was a fine
performance,&mdash;by any means!&rdquo; She looked
gravely at Herron, who reddened a little, but
stood his ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, Miss Fairfield, I didn&rsquo;t
mean any harm. Honest, I never dreamed of
offending you, or annoying you,&mdash;I thought
only of how to manage to keep you there for
our little party. Moreover I thought you&rsquo;d
think it a great joke,&mdash;honest, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herron&rsquo;s clear brown eyes were so earnest
and his expression so troubled, that Patty&rsquo;s
heart was touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it, Mr. Herron,&rdquo; and she
smiled kindly at him, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t just the
thing to do,&mdash;was it, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, forget it, Pattibelle, and if you
can&rsquo;t forget it&mdash;forgive it, anyway. Herron
meant no harm and I knew at once, that Dame
Doremus,&mdash;as I told you,&mdash;was no lady! But
I saw through Herron&rsquo;s motive as well as his
joke, and there&rsquo;s no great harm done that I
can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with Phil,&rdquo; and Helen nodded her
head positively; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jolly glad you did it,
for otherwise, I&rsquo;d have had to come home without
any luncheon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Than which there could be no worse hardship!&rdquo;
Herron sympathised. &ldquo;Am I forgiven,
Miss Fairfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Patty gave him a half smile,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over. Didn&rsquo;t you know this
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Adam! But, you know, you can
size up a chap a lot from appearances, and he
was a good sort, and amenable to&mdash;well, to
argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golden argument,&rdquo; laughed Philip. &ldquo;You
put it over, all right, Herron, old chap, and I&rsquo;m
sure Miss Fairfield will overlook her chaperon&rsquo;s
extra-sized feet! Had it not been that I
noticed those, I might have been fooled myself.
For the boy,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five or so,&mdash;I should judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his face was boyish, and his general
effect young, yet he donned age with his wig
and gown, and on the whole I call it a remarkable
bit of disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder he didn&rsquo;t knit!&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen. &ldquo;And no wonder he choked when I
proposed that we girls stay there longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted queerly all the time;&rdquo; Patty
looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking he knew too
much about me and my affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at now, Patty?&rdquo;
Helen asked. &ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll reappear in his
proper person, and presume on our acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he <i>won&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Reypen looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, the chap&rsquo;s all right, eh, Herron?
Credentials, and that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be or they wouldn&rsquo;t have him in the
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are spies everywhere,&rdquo; said Patty, in
a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pitty-Pat!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;is <i>that</i>
what&rsquo;s troubling you? Well, well! Those
letters you get from Washington do sure go to
your head! I see it, now, people! Bill tells
Patty to look out for spies, and so,&mdash;she sees
them everywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spies in the brooks, spies in the pastry-cooks!&rdquo;
exclaimed Herron, and Helen giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Patty suspects
every one of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; and Patty shook her
curly head. &ldquo;There <i>is</i> danger, isn&rsquo;t there,
Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, child. But even if this bad Mrs.
Doremus was a spy,&mdash;she learned nothing from
us, today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;he asked a heap of questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing of any importance. It seems
to me that,&mdash;Munson, is that his name?&mdash;only
showed such curiosity as would become an
elderly lady talking with two charming girls.
You practically told her&mdash;him,&mdash;of your engagement,
Patty, so you mustn&rsquo;t wonder that
he showed some interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so. Well, we won&rsquo;t say anything
more about it. I&rsquo;m foolish, I suppose,&mdash;but I
don&rsquo;t like that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I apologise,&rdquo; said Herron, heartily;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly sorry I did it, but I ask you to
believe that I would not have done it, had it
occurred to me for a moment that you would
feel about it as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe that,&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s blue eyes
shone with forgiveness and understanding. &ldquo;I
know, Mr. Herron, that you really did it out of
the kindest motives, and I exonerate you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! what a big word!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re exonerated, Mr. Herron, surely you
can&rsquo;t ask for more! Why, I thought to be ex&mdash;what
do you call it? was what the Pope does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child, that&rsquo;s to be excommunicated,
and Mr. Herron shan&rsquo;t be that!&rdquo; And Patty
beamed full forgiveness on the culprit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />LETTERS</h2>
<p>Captain William Farnsworth sat in his room, opening his
morning mail. Or rather, his morning
mail was waiting to be opened, while he eagerly
perused a letter from Miss Patricia Fairfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of pickled peppers!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
in a self-addressed murmur, &ldquo;she
<i>didn&rsquo;t</i>! she <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the letter said,&mdash;in part:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>so</i> glad you&rsquo;re thinking of coming to
New York in February! That&rsquo;s soon here!
Which day? What hour? Oh, my Little
Billee, how can I <i>wait</i> to see you! I want to
look in those dear, big, loving blue eyes, and
have them answer the questions I want to ask.
You know what the questions are! Oh, well,
suppose I do know the answers,&mdash;I guess a little
Patty Blossom can ask over again if her big Sir
Galahad loves her,&mdash;and why,&mdash;and how much,&mdash;and
a few such things,&mdash;that are important,
if true! And there is nothing in this whole
round world truer than our love,&mdash;is there,
dear? I just <i>live</i> in it,&mdash;when I am alone, I
thing of nothing but US, and, I&rsquo;m afraid I am
absent-minded, even when other people are
about. Do come home soon,&mdash;come to your
own Patty Posy. Tell me quick <i>when</i> to look
for you! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me sooner there
was hope of seeing you soon? My own dear
big man, my own, my owner, my ownest, I&rsquo;m
now and forever
<span class="center">&ldquo;Your</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Patty Blossom</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Farnsworth frowned,&mdash;he looked puzzled,
amazed, hurt.</p>
<p>Again he resorted to expletives. &ldquo;Great
jumping kangaroos!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see it! Patty never did such a thing!
never! But if not, how did she know? I believe
the very walls have not only ears but
tongues and pens in their hands, and a whole
wireless outfit beside! I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> suspect Patty,&mdash;and
yet,&mdash;all women are curious,&mdash;and, of
course, this doesn&rsquo;t matter so much,&mdash;but if I
can&rsquo;t trust her in everything how can I trust
her at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sigh, he laid the letter aside, and
turned to his business correspondence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Farnsworth&rsquo;s position was a responsible one,
and it contained and involved many secrets that
must be carefully guarded. Among these was
the fact and date of his next trip to New York.
It was on a matter of moment, and it was not
desirable that his absence from Washington
should be known. He had written Patty about
it, but he had enclosed the message in a sealed
envelope, with directions not to open it until
he wired her to do so. Thus, he planned, she
would know it in time, but the information
could not leak out. And now it had leaked out.
Patty knew and made no secret of the knowledge
that he was expected in New York. Had
she told others? And,&mdash;worst of all,&mdash;had she
opened the sealed letter before he told her to?
This was incredible,&mdash;yet, what other solution
or theory was possible? And there was
to be considered a grouchy old Colonel,
who would make all sorts of trouble for
Captain Farnsworth if it became known
that he was careless with his personal correspondence.</p>
<p>Because of his well-trained mind, and his
power of concentration, Farnsworth forced
himself to attend to matters in hand, but ever
and again flashed across his preoccupied brain
the fact that Patty had disregarded his
instructions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>He lived with a pleasant family in the Capital,
and his quarters were the whole of the second
floor of the small house. This gave him a
good-sized sitting room, which was his private
office, and here he transacted all business that
didn&rsquo;t require his presence at the more public
buildings.</p>
<p>He kept doggedly at work, determined not to
let the disturbing episode interfere with his
efficiency. And he succeeded, but only by dint
of perseverance in his resolve not to think of
Patty at all.</p>
<p>This was difficult, for every glance of his eye
fell on something remindful of her. A photograph
on his desk; other little snapshots lurking
among his papers; a paper-cutter she had
given him; indeed, the pen he wrote with was
her parting gift; and all spoke eloquently of
the girl he had so reluctantly left behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busy, Captain?&rdquo; called a gay voice, and a
merry face peeped in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always busy,&rdquo; he returned, cheerily, &ldquo;but
never too busy to say good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what that means! That I must
say good morning, and nothing more! But I
do want just half a dozen more words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The piquant face smiled coaxingly, as Lena
Richards danced in. She was the daughter of
the house, a dark-haired, olive-skinned little
gipsy, who, being quite spoiled by her doting
parents, assumed the right to have her own way
with every one else.</p>
<p>Farnsworth liked her as no one could help
doing, but he was often obliged to speak more
curtly than he liked to, or she would intrude too
often on his time.</p>
<p>She wore a smock of pink linen and her curly
hair was bundled into a little Dutch cap. She
came in, with the venturesome air of a mischievous
child, and perched saucily on the
corner of the big desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in an awful
scrape&mdash;well, that is, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not, but somebody
else is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Farnsworth, smiling at
the roguish little face that wore such a troubled
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose everybody is, more or less,
from the President down. And when you
think of that, my little brother does seem small,
but&mdash;you see, to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a national calamity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personal rather than national,&mdash;yet it may
be said to be international.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of our troubles are. Your story interests
me strangely,&mdash;my che-ild,&mdash;but truly,
Lena, I can&rsquo;t take time now to hear the yarn.
I suppose your fudge was lumpy, or your new
ribbons don&rsquo;t match your frock,&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always talk as if I were a child!&rdquo; and
the scarlet lips pouted petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! I always think of you as a kiddy
in a middy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a middy, it&rsquo;s a smock, and a very
grown up one at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do smocks grow up? Thought they only
grew old. Well, anyway, whatever your age,
I&rsquo;ve no time to waste on you this morning. My
country needs me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so unkind to me,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
two crystal drops formed in the big, brown
eyes.</p>
<p>Now, William Farnsworth was the sort of
man who can&rsquo;t stand seeing a woman in distress.
And though he knew that this sixteen-year-old
chit could have no real or deep trouble,
he yet could not bring himself to speak sternly
to her, and tell her to leave the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Against his will, he obeyed the dictates of his
kind heart, and taking out his watch, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten minutes. Spill your story
in Papa&rsquo;s ear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark little face lighted with gladness,
and Lena murmured, &ldquo;How good you are!
Listen, then! You know my friend, Gracie
Hadley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the pleasure. Who&rsquo;s she in
America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s just Gracie, that&rsquo;s all. And&mdash;sh!&rdquo;&mdash;Lena
looked cautiously about, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
breathe it, but she&rsquo;s in love with an English
chap who&rsquo;s over here. And her mother doesn&rsquo;t
approve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Who&rsquo;s the Britisher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s Gracie&rsquo;s
secret&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I don&rsquo;t want to know anyway.
But where do I come in? I hate to hurry you,
but I&rsquo;m assuming I play a part in this tragedy,
and I want my cue, for honest to goodness,
Lena, I&rsquo;ve troubles of my own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Captain, and I won&rsquo;t be but a
minute explaining. Well, Gracie has been corresponding
with this man,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, naughty! naughty!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! It&rsquo;s all right; only of course, she
doesn&rsquo;t want her mother to know. Well, she
tears up his letters, but&mdash;<i>what</i> do you think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Censor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! but the man has given her her letters
to him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returned them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I mean yes,&mdash;but for this reason&mdash;you
fluster me so,&mdash;with your snapping up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, go and tell it in your own way.
But, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You see he gave her these letters
to save for him just while he&rsquo;s away somewhere,
and he wants them when he comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t she write some more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re so unfeeling! So&mdash;why,
you&rsquo;re <i>stupid</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&mdash;sorry! Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind details,&mdash;Gracie can&rsquo;t keep
them at home, for fear her mother will
find them&mdash;she snoops awfully! And&mdash;<i>I</i> can&rsquo;t
keep them here,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a similar reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; exactly! So,&mdash;Captain Farnsworth,&mdash;nice,
dear Captain Farnsworth, won&rsquo;t you let
me hid them in here,&mdash;among your things?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! Little One, is that all you want?
Sure! Hide them wherever you like in my
domain. Your eagle-eyed mother won&rsquo;t find
them in here! But, hold on! Nothing that
wouldn&rsquo;t get by the Censor, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no! Nothing like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to have a glimpse of &rsquo;em,
though. Not to pry into the lovers&rsquo; confidences,
of course, but because I can&rsquo;t harbour
papers unless I&rsquo;m satisfied of their contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;that goes! I&rsquo;ll get them now;&rdquo;
and running from the room, Lena returned with
a small packet of letters tied with blue ribbon.</p>
<p>Farnsworth examined the envelopes, and
glanced here and there at the written pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, re-tying the packet, &ldquo;internal
evidence proves conclusively to <i>my</i> mind
that these documents are just what you describe
them to be. Say we put them in the top drawer
of my chiffonier; how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Mother would never dream of looking
in your room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope not! And now may I, without
undue haste, bid you a very good
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to go, if you put it like that.
I did want to tell you more about Gracie; and
there&rsquo;s something I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, not now, my child. I am busy&mdash;see?
B-U-S-Y! My Flag comes before my
friends! Thus, you see my friends follow the
Flag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so witty! And so kind. Thank
you lots, Captain, and when you&rsquo;re not so busy,
may I talk to you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that time ever comes! But it never will
unless you clear out! Scoot now!&rdquo; Farnsworth
held the door persuadingly open, and
Lena didn&rsquo;t scoot, but she went slowly and
reluctantly out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty little nuisance!&rdquo; muttered the
Captain, as he closed and locked his door.</p>
<p>Without further interruption, Bill put in the
morning on his war work, and at last was free
to consider the case against Patty Fairfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s true blue,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;far too true
to do anything she deemed wrong or even indiscreet.
But I suppose she didn&rsquo;t realise how
definite,&mdash;how imperative my instructions were,&mdash;maybe
I didn&rsquo;t tell her distinctly enough,&mdash;maybe
she forgot,&mdash;or was really overcome
with a desire to know what was in that sealed
note. Oh, well, I must warn her further. I
hate to hurt her,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t let her think I distrust
her,&mdash;and Lord knows I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>! How I
wish I had more time! But I&rsquo;ve that appointment
at two&mdash;and&mdash;whew! I&rsquo;ll have to
scribble to Patty pretty fast, whatever I say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The result, after one or two torn-up attempts,
was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Own Patty Blossom,&mdash;my Posy Face,&mdash;my
Best Beloved: I&rsquo;ve only a minute to write
this time, and so I must come to the point at
once. Dear Heart,&mdash;<i>did</i> you open the sealed
note before I told you to? Oh, well,&mdash;I know
you did so never mind about that,&mdash;but, my
precious little girl, don&rsquo;t, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t ever do it
again. You see, I send you notes thus, so that
you can open them in haste when I wire you
that you may. Now, if you open them sooner,
I never know where we stand. In this matter,
darling, please consider my wishes&mdash;and, especially
because I meant to send a really valuable
paper to you, in order that you might hand it
to me when I do come to New York, and I
won&rsquo;t have to carry it with me or trust it to the
general mail. I can&rsquo;t explain all these matters,
as you know, dear, but I do want to feel that
in the government work that is entrusted to
<i>me</i>, I can as implicitly trust <i>you</i> to be my aid
and helper. Can&rsquo;t I, Sweetheart? Of course,
I know I can, and I know your eager haste to
learn my plans led you to open that letter before
time. So, don&rsquo;t do it again, and all will
be well. Now, I&rsquo;ve not another minute, but I
<i>must</i> take time to say once again that I love
you, and you&rsquo;re all the world to me, my dear,
<i>dear</i> little Posy Patty.
<span class="center">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m your faithful and devoted</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Little Billee</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>When Patty received this letter she read it
and sat aghast. What could he mean? She
had never opened a letter until he told her to!
Many times she had received permission by
mail or by wire, and then she had opened the
sealed notes so frequently enclosed in Bill&rsquo;s
letters to her. But never before she got the
word! Never,&mdash;never!</p>
<p>Again she read the pages from Washington.
Had Farnsworth imagined it or what had made
him dream that she had done such a thing?</p>
<p>She? Not to be trusted! When every
thought she had, every deed she did was with
the one trust and hope that she might help her
Captain,&mdash;even in the smallest way!</p>
<p>She went to her writing desk and from a
locked drawer she took Bill&rsquo;s sealed note, that
had come with a recent letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>It was still sealed. Why would he think she
had opened it? Oh, well, she thought, something
has made him think so. I must write him
at once that I didn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll believe me, of
course. I know his faith and trust, and they
are not misplaced, that&rsquo;s certain!</p>
<p>So, a letter was quickly written and despatched
telling the Captain that his aid and helper in
New York had not been false to her trust in
the minutest particular.</p>
<p>But Patty was still puzzled and gave much
thought to the matter.</p>
<p>When Van Reypen came to say good-bye on
the eve of his departure for camp, he found a
quiet and worried little girl, who received him
with but a slight smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my Lady Fair, you look as if you&rsquo;d
lost your last friend,&mdash;or, perhaps, as if you
were about to lose him! May I take this general
air of gloom as a tribute to my regrettable
absence? Is it just &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re going to lose
your little old friend that you look so disconsolate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! it isn&rsquo;t! In the first place, I don&rsquo;t
look sad, and in the second place, if I do, it
isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m doing any &lsquo;Leah, the forsaken,&rsquo;
act! I shall miss you, of course, but
in these days we must learn to miss people!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Patty, and have you any idea,&mdash;any
faint glimmering of a notion, how I shall
miss you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil, I know all grades of missing! I&rsquo;m no
novice at it. Since this war called them, I&rsquo;ve
missed acquaintances, casual friends, old
friends, relatives, and, of course, most of all,
my own Little Billee. Now, I shall miss you,&mdash;and
I know you&rsquo;ll miss me,&mdash;but, you&rsquo;ll soon
get so interested in your work&mdash;in the great
game,&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll&mdash;oh, not forget me, I&rsquo;m
sure,&mdash;but my memory will become, let us say,
a little blurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it won&rsquo;t! But, hold on here, if it
isn&rsquo;t my departure, what is it that has made
your countenance sicklied o&rsquo;er with a pale cast
of&mdash;something or other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rice powder, probably! Does it really
make me look sickly? Good gracious!&rdquo; Patty
scrubbed at her cheeks with her handkerchief,
until they were rosy indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope; you can&rsquo;t rub it off! It&rsquo;s ingrained.
Come now, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am bothered. Philip, how do war
secrets leak out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do they keep from it, you mean!
Why, Patty, the end and aim of a majority of
our citizens seems to be to chatter and make
trouble thereby. What&rsquo;s exploded now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I can tell you,&mdash;only,&mdash;well,&mdash;never
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You transparent little goose! Have you
been and went and told something Farnsworth
told you not to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t! But he thought I did, so
it&rsquo;s just as bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not <i>just</i> as bad,&mdash;but, bad. What
was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, but he thought I opened a
sealed envelope and it&rsquo;s still sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it been out of your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! and locked away when you are
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always; locked in a secret drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, again. Then, you&rsquo;re all right. But
let me warn you, Patty, to be most exceedingly
cautious. Farnsworth&rsquo;s work is of the highest
importance, and his plans must not be known in
advance. I know this even better than you do,
and I beg of you to be even over-careful of any
orders he may give you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am! I do! But you see, this matter
must have leaked out some other way, and he
thought it was because of my knowledge of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty!&rdquo; Philip spoke suddenly; &ldquo;did you
have that letter with you that day at the
Timothy Grass Club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I had just received it that morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you carry it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my fur stole; there&rsquo;s a buttoned pocket
in the end of it, and it&rsquo;s a safe place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that Munson,&mdash;that masquerader,&mdash;wore
your stole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did!&rdquo; and Patty looked frightened.
&ldquo;But, no! that&rsquo;s all right, Phil. The enclosed
note was still sealed when I reached home, and
it is sealed yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; but don&rsquo;t take any chances.
Leave your letters at home and carefully locked
up, if they contain anything outside your entirely
personal affairs. I speak whereof I
know, Patty, and you <i>must</i> be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Philip, oh, truly I will,&rdquo; and Patty
gave the promise in all sincerity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />A VALENTINE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Helen Barlow, dashing
into Patty&rsquo;s room one morning, &ldquo;I
am certainly having the time of my
sweet young life! They may say what they
like about the horrors of war, and there are
plenty of them, and nobody knows that better
than I do, and nobody does more to help our
side than you do, but all the same, my fairy-fair
cousin, I do get a lot of pleasant parties
and happy hours out of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bumble-Bee, what&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at all these letters in my morning&rsquo;s
mail! And nearly every one an invitation to a
gathering of some sort, connected with Our
Boys. Dinners and evening parties and little
dances, all for the Khaki and the Blue! Red
Cross Benefits, private charities and any number
of War Relief meetings! Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
a heartless wretch, Patsy, but I do love the
everlasting gadding about, and meeting people
and being in the excitement of it all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Bumble,&rdquo; said Nan, coming
in, &ldquo;having heard your views, I&rsquo;ll invite you to
help me with a small and early bazaar I&rsquo;m
arranging for a Valentine f&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll do all I can, Nan. Tell me
more. When is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the twelfth; we want to sell valentines
to send to the soldiers in camp, and incidentally,
have a good time, and, moreover, make a little
money for my committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you going to have it?&rdquo; asked Patty,
looking up from her desk, where she was writing
letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t do
much, Pattikins, you&rsquo;ve so many irons in the
fire; Bumble and I will run this show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! I have about all I can
manage on a paltry twenty-four hours a day.
But I&rsquo;ll buy a valentine of you to send to my
own particular Soldier Boy. Oh, Nan, isn&rsquo;t he
the dearest thing! Just look at this new picture
of him! Did anybody <i>ever</i> look so well
in a uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sure great!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumble, taking
the picture; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you rave over
him, Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Nan agreed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so big, yet so
well-proportioned that he doesn&rsquo;t look <i>too</i>
big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i> you, Nan! I dunno what I&rsquo;d do
if he were <i>too</i> big!&rdquo; Patty showed mock
alarm at the thought. &ldquo;You see, the bigger he
is the smaller I seem, but I&rsquo;m trying to emulate
Bumble, and get a little more weighty. It&rsquo;s
hard, though, with the food conservation to be
looked after, and the sweetless days here and
there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t have any sweetless days, if
you read those long letters you get,&rdquo; put in
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, how do <i>you</i> know as to their
sweetness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a mind reader, and when I see you
peruse a letter, and fairly lap it up, like a cat,
and then sit looking like the cat who ate the
canary, I don&rsquo;t have to be a detective to deduce
that the letter was a sweet one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Bumble! You guessed right
the very first time! My Captain&rsquo;s letters <i>are</i>
sweet, and so is he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a valentine! And he&rsquo;s in love
and so is she!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said Patty, complacently. &ldquo;And
that&rsquo;s no secret. As to valentines, pick me out
the prettiest and the wittiest and the one that
reads best, and save it for me, when you two
busy bees have this festa,&mdash;or whatever you
call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! What shall we call it?&rdquo; and
Helen turned to Nan. &ldquo;Ought to begin with
a V. Valentine Valley? Valentine Villa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very good,&rdquo; Nan considered. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
Valentine Verses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All valentines have verses. Help us out,
Patty. Do that much for the cause. Give us
a name for our Sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine Vendue,&rdquo; said Patty, without looking
up from her writing. Though apparently
absorbed in her own affairs she had heard all
they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vendue is an auction,&rdquo; objected Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it means a sale,&rdquo; Patty defended,
&ldquo;and too, of course, you&rsquo;ll auction off the left-overs,
they always do at a sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have it all an auction,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, do,&rdquo; returned Patty, &ldquo;but run
away, kiddies, and make your plans somewhere
else, won&rsquo;t you? Miss Fairfield is busy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bumble, we&rsquo;ll go off and flock by
ourselves. And we&rsquo;ll plan such a bee-yutiful
party that we&rsquo;ll sell enough valentines for the
whole National Army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they want valentines?&rdquo; asked Helen as
she went off with Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, my dear. The thing
is for us to sell the valentines, and get the
money for the committee; and then, if the sweet
missives are never sent, it won&rsquo;t matter. But,
yes, I think the boys in camp would be jolly
glad to get nice loving valentine verses. They
needn&rsquo;t know who sends them, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall put my name on all <i>I</i> send. I&rsquo;d like
to get a letter back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mail is full of such letters already!
You&rsquo;re a camp belle, Bumble,&mdash;you certainly
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might make a joke about the camp belles
are coming!&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d scorn
to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. Come on, now, and let&rsquo;s make
lists and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The night of February twelfth found the Fairfield
house bedecked for the Valentine Vendue.
Palms and flowers and hearts and darts and
ribbon streamers and true-love knots were
everywhere. Patty had helped both with advice
and with actual work and the result was
bewilderingly beautiful. Not only the regulation
valentines of lace paper and rhymed
lines were for sale, but also small and appropriate
gifts, in decorated boxes, fancy bonbonnieres,
pots and baskets of flowers and flowering
plants, and even jewelled trinkets and
curios. For these things had been donated for
the cause, and the venders hoped the men would
buy them for their sweethearts.</p>
<p>Also there were valentines for the soldiers,
and boxes of tobacco and cigarettes, containing
sentimental missives.</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s committee was a large one, and all had
worked diligently until the result was even more
gratifying than they had hoped.</p>
<p>Patty and Helen wore effective and appropriate
costumes for they loved to &ldquo;dress up,&rdquo;
and this was too good a chance to be lost.</p>
<p>Their short frocks were of white tarlatan,
edged with lace, and much befrilled. Garlands
of tiny rosebuds decked the skirts, and the
bodices were trimmed with blue ribbons and gilt
paper hearts. Toy Cupids perched on their
shoulders, and love-knots of blue decked their
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect Lieutenant Herron?&rdquo; Helen
asked, as they awaited the guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; returned Patty, &ldquo;considering he&rsquo;s
always about wherever you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! It&rsquo;s <i>you</i> he hovers over! Don&rsquo;t be
coy,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t fool your little Bumble-bee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a silly!&rdquo; laughed Patty; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
no use for the Herron person. If he&rsquo;s here
tonight, I&rsquo;ll take it as a favour if you&rsquo;ll charm
him away from my haunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and Helen shrugged her
shoulders. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be charmed. Moreover,
I&rsquo;ve a lot of my own particular friends
coming, and I&rsquo;ll have my hands full to entertain
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nan was right when she called you a camp
belle. You&rsquo;re looking sweet tonight, Bumble,
and I s&rsquo;pect some man will buy you for a valentine.
Is Chester coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so. Wish he wasn&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s such a
burr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does stick to you. I&rsquo;ll take him for
a while, and give you some rest. I like Mr.
Wilde a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests began to arrive, and soon the
rooms were really crowded. The valentines
sold quickly, for those who did not want them
bought &ldquo;for the good of the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Lieutenant Herron came early, and as Bumble
had predicted, he attached himself to Patty&rsquo;s
train of followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a clutter of men about you!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as he sought her side, edging his way
through a group of valentine buyers. &ldquo;I say,
Miss Fairfield, let some one else sell these
people for a while, and you come and have an
ice with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not selling the people!&rdquo; cried Patty,
smiling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selling valentines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same. But you need a rest. Come
along, and take it, and come back to your work
refreshed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty was tired, and so she asked some one
else to take her place for a while, and sauntered
off with Herron.</p>
<p>They found a pleasant table in the supper
room, and sat down together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw your friend Van Reypen yesterday,&rdquo;
said Herron, after he had given their order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did? How is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit as a fiddle, and learning to fly, like a
young robin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d be an apt pupil. Phil is
clever at &rsquo;most anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. And he takes to aviation like
a duck to water. What do you hear from your
other friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My other friend! Have I then but one
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty well knew Lieutenant Herron meant
Little Billee, but she was always chary of talking
about Farnsworth to anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one that you care for; isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I care for lots of people, and I
care for all our soldiers! How can you think
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a sense. But only one you care for
especially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. If you mean Captain Farnsworth,
and I suppose you do,&mdash;most girls care
especially for the men they are engaged to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really engaged to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am! Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tone belies your words; what do you
mean, Lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s eyes gave an ominous flash that her
friends all knew indicated serious indignation,
but Herron answered lightly, &ldquo;Oh, nothing,
really. I only happened to hear from a friend,
of Farnsworth&rsquo;s infatuation for a little dark-eyed
beauty down in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Patty looked at him, amusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re teasing me, your jest is in poor
taste, Lieutenant Herron. If you&rsquo;re in earnest,
I refuse to listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t get huffy! I didn&rsquo;t
mean to stir you up! I only heard rumours,&mdash;doubtless
there&rsquo;s nothing in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless there isn&rsquo;t,&mdash;and, also, doubtless
it doesn&rsquo;t concern you, if there is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty was thoroughly angry at the man&rsquo;s impertinence,
but she did not want to do anything
so conspicuous as to get up and leave the dining-room,
where many small tables were occupied
by a merry crowd of guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all! not at all! yet, I can&rsquo;t regret
my words, since they have given me an opportunity
of seeing you when you are ruffled!
Prettier than ever! How blue eyes can
flash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Patty felt a fear of this man. He
did not seem to ring true. But her quick-wittedness
made her realise that to continue
angry, was to make him more amused and
interested, so she changed her tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any girl&rsquo;s eyes would flash at your insinuations,&rdquo;
she said, with a sudden bright smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now I know you are chaffing, I don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know I&rsquo;m chaffing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your own eyes twinkle so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Herron&rsquo;s eyes were snapping
maliciously, but Patty ignored this, and
deftly turned the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you go back to the Aviation
Field?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, alas! I had hoped for longer
leave, but a new class is to be trained, and I
must be on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help marvelling at the courage and
bravery of an aviator. It seems to me that
you take your life in your hands ever more desperately
and dangerously than those actually at
the front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, we do,&rdquo; agreed Herron, a little
gravely. &ldquo;As the darky said, &lsquo;If yuh gets
killed on the ground, yuh knows where yuh
is; but if yuh gets killed up in de air,&mdash;where
is yuh?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so many do get killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the proportion continually grows
smaller, of course, as we learn more of the
art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call aviation an art?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an Art with a big A! It&rsquo;s a science as
well, to be sure; it&rsquo;s also a mechanical process
and&mdash;it&rsquo;s largely sheer luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Mr. Van Reypen is doing well.
He has a cool head, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s a great thing. A steady
nerve, and mental poise come first in the requirements
for a successful flyer. When are
you to be married, Miss Fairfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! You take my breath away
with your sudden questions. Incidentally, they
are a bit rude. Do you ask about such personal
matters in your home town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herron had the grace to blush. But he said,
slowly, &ldquo;I suppose I would, if I cared as much
to know as I do in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? You know why! You must know!
Because I&rsquo;m over head and ears in love with
you, myself! Because, though it would add to
my misery to know you&rsquo;re to be married soon,
yet it would be a blessed relief to know it would
<i>not</i> be soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see, Lieutenant Herron, that these
matters concern you at all,&rdquo; said Patty, icily,
and then the look of pained reproach he gave
her smote her heart. For Patty was a gentle
soul, and rarely hurt the feelings of anybody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must ask you to drop this subject
and never refer to it again.&rdquo; But she spoke
softly, and shook off her air of offended dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;truly I didn&rsquo;t
mean to! But I couldn&rsquo;t help it. You&rsquo;re
right, it&rsquo;s none of my business, and I apologise.
Come, I see you&rsquo;re ready to leave here, let us
go and buy a valentine, which you shall send
to your betrothed, and then you&rsquo;ll forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was gay again, and glad that the
tension of the situation was relieved, Patty went
with him to the valentine tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a dandy!&rdquo; remarked the pretty girl
who was selling them. &ldquo;New idea, too.
Funny and yet clever! Want one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herron took the one offered, and smiled as he
read its lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare send <i>that</i> to your
fiance!&rdquo; he said, laughingly.</p>
<p>Carelessly, Patty glanced at it. It was a well-done
little sketch of a lover and his lass, leaning
over a rustic stile, in true valentine fashion.
Cupids and turtle-doves hovered above, and
hearts and darts formed a conventional margin.</p>
<p>The lines read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our love is high as Heaven</p>
<p class="t">And wide as rolling sea;</p>
<p class="t0">The vows cannot be riven</p>
<p class="t">That bind my love and me.</p>
<p class="t0">But should our pledge be broken,</p>
<p class="t">Or should your love be dead,</p>
<p class="t0">Send back this tender token</p>
<p class="t">And let us never wed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; laughed Patty, &ldquo;what a
woe-begone outlook for such a happy-looking
pair! And I&rsquo;m sure such a dismal foreboding
could never come true for these rustic swains!
They&rsquo;re a real Strephon and Chloe couple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I see you don&rsquo;t take my dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you to send that valentine to Captain
Farnsworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You think I hesitate, lest he return
it to me!&rdquo; The absurdity of this struck Patty
as very funny, and she laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; and Herron laughed, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous you are! Why, I&rsquo;d just as
lief send that as not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, and do it, then. Prove your
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you buy it for me, at a goodly price?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever the saleslady asks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. What&rsquo;s the price, Maisie?&rdquo;
Greatly amused, the gay little sales-girl said,
&ldquo;Ten dollars, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little daunted, but true to his word, Herron
paid the price, and took Patty to the library,
where there was a desk made ready for any
who desired to address and despatch their
missives then and there.</p>
<p>Patty wrote Farnsworth&rsquo;s Washington address,
and Herron held out his hand for the
envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mail it as I go home,&rdquo; he said, and
Patty gave it to him.</p>
<p>The whole incident made little impression on
her, for though she didn&rsquo;t particularly admire
the valentine, nor did she care for the so-called
&ldquo;poetry&rdquo; on it, yet, at the same time, it meant
an extra ten dollar bill in the coffers of the
committee, and that was well worth while.</p>
<p>Not much later, the Lieutenant said good
night, for, as he stated, he had to leave for his
duties early next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry if I offended you, Miss Fairfield,
and I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me,&rdquo; he begged.
&ldquo;But,&mdash;well, my only excuse is, the temptation
was too great, and the opportunity was mine,
so I said more than I intended, and more than
I ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Lieutenant, if you didn&rsquo;t mean it,
I forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&mdash;for that
wouldn&rsquo;t be true; but I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; and Patty spoke gravely, now,
&ldquo;never let any circumstance or opportunity
tempt you to do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I mustn&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; Herron said, in a
low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then don&rsquo;t see me. It will be far
better for both. Where is your sense of
honour? of fairness? Another man&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e
is not to be thought of, save with respect and
courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; and the man looked miserably
sad; &ldquo;and I do mean to treat you with all
respect and courtesy,&mdash;but, oh, Miss Fairfield,
Patty,&mdash;let me call you that just once,&mdash;if you
knew how broken up I am over it all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Patty, firmly, though she was
touched at the sight of his evident suffering,
&ldquo;then the only thing is for us not to meet
again, at all. I&rsquo;m sorry, Lieutenant Herron,
for I like you, but these matters are often outside
our own will, and so, I can see no way but
for us to keep apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I not come to see you next time I&rsquo;m
in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Patty, gently, and then
she bade him a courteous but definite and final
good night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />PATTY IN TEARS</h2>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s bedroom was a pretty, cheery
and charming place. The sunlight came
in through delicate, lacy curtains, the
furniture and appointments were all that a fastidious
taste could desire, and the pictures and
trinkets scattered about were beautiful and
attractive. There were always fresh flowers in
the vases and the whole effect was conducive to
happiness and contentment.</p>
<p>Yet across the lace-covered bed was the outstretched
form of somebody who had flung herself
there in a very abandonment of woe.
Somebody with golden curly hair, from which
the boudoir cap had fallen unheeded; somebody
who was digging a little wet mop of a handkerchief
into eyes that flowed with tears like
a very freshet of rain. Somebody who was
shaking and quivering with great racking sobs
that were all the more agonising because they
were silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Patty was crying. And with her ever-active
efficiency, she was making a thorough and complete
success of it. Now and then, she would
pause, sit up and vigorously wipe her eyes, then
she would fling herself back into the nest of
damp pillows and start all over again. Her
pretty neglig&eacute;e of light blue silk was crumpled
into a shocking state; one little slipper had
fallen off, and though her face was buried in
the pillows her heaving shoulders and tumbled
curls still bore witness to the woe that was
torturing her soul.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she became angry, and sat up
straight, fists clenched, eyes blazing,&mdash;fairly
gritting her teeth in a wave of indignation.</p>
<p>Then again, grief, deep, hopeless grief overcame
her, and back she fell, fresh tears welling
up and spilling over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; cried Bumble, bouncing into the
room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a splendid plan! Let&rsquo;s get a
whole lot of top balloons, and&mdash;for the love
of Michaelovitch Paderewski! what <i>is</i> the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously Bumble looked at the shaking figure
on the bed. With a frightened face, she came
cautiously toward Patty, unable to believe her
eyes at the sight of her cousin&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get out! go &rsquo;way!&rdquo; wailed Patty, in such
hollow tones that they scarce seemed her own
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty! dear! my own little darling cousin,
what <i>is</i> it? Tell Bumble! Tell me, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-nothing! Go away, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go away! How can I, when I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s the matter with you! Are you
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;oh, Bumble, don&rsquo;t pester me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what ails you, Patty? You don&rsquo;t even
speak like yourself. I&rsquo;m going to call Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t! Yes, do! Oh, I don&rsquo;t care
what you do!&rdquo; and a brand-new deluge poured
forth, as Patty sat up and stared at Helen with
eyes full of utter woe as well as gushing tears.</p>
<p>Thoroughly frightened, Helen did call Nan,
who came at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor little thing,&rdquo; she said, sitting
down beside Patty, and caressing her, as
she offered a fresh handkerchief in place of the
squeezed up mop in Patty&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear, don&rsquo;t try to talk,&mdash;just be
quiet. And cry all you like,&mdash;but, gracious! I
didn&rsquo;t know one person <i>could</i> hold so many
tears! Now, hush, dear, don&rsquo;t talk. Keep
right on crying, it&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s comforting voice and her tender whimsicality,
helped Patty, and she sobbed in Nan&rsquo;s
arms, for a time, then, by degrees, her tears
began to be somewhat checked, and she stopped
shaking.</p>
<p>Nan only patted her gently, and crooned comforting
little sounds, that soothed the tortured
nerves by their loving tone.</p>
<p>At last, Patty stopped crying for the simple
reason, apparently, that her tears had at last
become exhausted.</p>
<p>Helen had brought a fresh relay of handkerchiefs,
and as Patty half-unconsciously accepted
one after another, the bed was strewn
with the moistened squares of linen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; warned Bumble, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going
to begin again, go easy on this; it&rsquo;s the last one
of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty,&rdquo; assured Nan, &ldquo;cry away,
Patty, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s intuition told her that Patty must have
her cry out, before any explanation could be
forthcoming. And it was so. Every time the
tears ceased and Patty undertook to talk, just
so often the floods burst forth again. Helen
grew a bit impatient, and wanted to know what
it was all about, but Nan gave her a warning
glance, that curbed her curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>For Nan knew Patty&rsquo;s temperament, and
knew, too, that only some really great matter
lay at the bottom of this outbreak.</p>
<p>At last, a point was reached, where it seemed
that the tears were really exhausted, and, weak
and white, Patty looked with loving gratitude
into Nan&rsquo;s comforting eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, dear,&rdquo; Nan said, kissing the
flushed cheek,&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a dry pillow, now, rest.
I&rsquo;m going to get you a glass of milk and a
biscuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Nan returned, Patty was quiet, and
very sad-looking. Helen was trying to cheer
her up by talking nonsense, but Patty paid little
heed to her chatter.</p>
<p>Mechanically she took the milk that Nan
brought, and nibbled at a biscuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this, people,&rdquo; she said, at length, &ldquo;you
might as well know, first as last. Billee has
thrown me over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen stared, aghast, but Nan laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;all that fuss for a
simple little lovers&rsquo; quarrel! Well I suppose
you are a simple little lover, and I daresay Bill
has no notion of it all. <i>What&rsquo;s</i> your fancied
grievance? And, I must admit I&rsquo;m relieved!
I feared it was something serious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it is!&rdquo; flashed Patty; &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll
think so when you know. I sent him a val&mdash;valentine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that upset the apple-cart? Why, why;
was it a &lsquo;comic&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease, Nan, it&rsquo;s fearful. You saw the
valentine, didn&rsquo;t you, Bumble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t remember anything about
it. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; and Patty drew from beneath
a pillow a moist, bedraggled paper, that had
once been a gay, crisp sheet.</p>
<p>Nan took it and smoothed it out. She saw a
blurred picture of two rustic lovers and with
some difficulty she read the absurd lines
beneath.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our love is high as Heaven</p>
<p class="t">And wide as rolling sea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she read aloud, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right, seems to me,&mdash;Little
Billee can&rsquo;t have thrown you over for
<i>that</i> sentiment! Now, I&rsquo;ll read further:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The vows cannot be riven</p>
<p class="t">That bind my love and me.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Orthodox, I&rsquo;m sure. Not a perfect rhyme,
perhaps, but that&rsquo;s not enough to quarrel over!
Let&rsquo;s see what comes next:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But should our pledge be broken</p>
<p class="t">Or should your love be dead,</p>
<p class="t0">Send back this tender token</p>
<p class="t">And let us never wed.</p>
</div>
<p>Why, Patty Fairfield, do you mean to say you
sent this ridiculous thing to your Little Billee!
I don&rsquo;t wonder he sent it back! It&rsquo;s silly beyond
words! Why did you send such a
horror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Patty, a little shame-facedly,
&ldquo;mostly because Lieutenant Herron dared me
to, and I never will be dared. But, oh, Nan,
I don&rsquo;t care if it is a foolish valentine, he <i>did</i>
send it back,&mdash;and, don&rsquo;t you see, it says,
&lsquo;Send back this tender token, and let us never
wed,&rsquo;&mdash;and he <i>did</i> send it back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s eyes were large and scared-looking,
and, though she didn&rsquo;t cry now, she looked as
if she were about ready to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nan looked bewildered,&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s awful! I
don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re upset, Patty! But, hold
on, maybe somebody else got it and sent it
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Patty forlornly showed the envelope.
&ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s his writing, mailed in
Washington, yesterday&mdash;oh,&mdash;how could he?
Why should he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty Fairfield, behave yourself!&rdquo; Nan
gave her a little shake; &ldquo;do you mean to tell
me Bill Farnsworth means he returns your
valentine&mdash;your love-token!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is! That&rsquo;s the one I sent him, and
it <i>says</i> to return it if his love is dead&mdash;and,
he&rsquo;s returned it! And that horrid Herron told
me about a&mdash;a b-black-eyed b-beauty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Patty! be sensible! It can&rsquo;t
be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, how <i>do</i> you explain it? Why
should I send that thing to him a few days ago,
and get it back today? Why would he return
it&mdash;there&rsquo;s no mistaking his writing, look at
it&mdash;unless he meant me to take it as it&rsquo;s printed
there! He has been bewitched by that b-black-eyed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Patty! Don&rsquo;t talk such absolute
rubbish! I know Bill Farnsworth, and I
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous! Fie, Patty, for shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nan,&rdquo; interposed Bumble, &ldquo;as Patty
says, what does it mean? I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt
Little Billee&rsquo;s faith and loyalty either, only, in
the face of this thing, what can we think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe Bill meant that! He&rsquo;s
teasing you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty way to tease!&rdquo; Patty was angry
now. &ldquo;And you know he isn&rsquo;t a tease. He
never plays jokes like Kit Cameron, or Chick
Channing might. No, Nan, he has been
bowled over by a Washington girl and he wants
to get rid of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; and Nan spoke very seriously, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t right for you so to doubt the man you&rsquo;ve
promised to marry. I can&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t believe
that he means this as you take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else can he mean it? If you&rsquo;ll give me
a rational explanation of what he <i>does</i> mean,
I&rsquo;ll be only too glad. I&rsquo;ve thought and
thought, and I can&rsquo;t imagine any meaning but
the actual fact that the printed words say to
send the valentine back if his love is dead,&mdash;and
he did send it back! Now, for your
explanation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Patty. I confess I don&rsquo;t. It
isn&rsquo;t like him to do it to tease you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it isn&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;d never do such a
cruel, heartless thing as that,&mdash;if he still loved
me. So, he <i>has</i> done the cruel thing,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
because he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Helen,
breaking a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do,&rdquo; replied Patty, hopelessly,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t write and beg him to take me
back. I have some pride! Nor can I ask
what I&rsquo;ve done to forfeit his regard. For I
know I haven&rsquo;t done anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve flirted with Phil Van Reypen,&rdquo; said
Helen, accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; flared Patty. &ldquo;On the contrary,
I&rsquo;ve been very careful not to! He&rsquo;s
flirted with me, if you like, but I&rsquo;ve not encouraged
him. You know I haven&rsquo;t, Nan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally, dear, but you have been
with him a great deal of late,&mdash;and Little Billee
is of a jealous nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; and Patty sighed, forlornly;
&ldquo;I only wish it were! Then I could
ask his pardon and make up and all that. No,
my Billee has found somebody he likes
better&rsquo;n me. I&rsquo;m Leah, the Forsaken,&mdash;after
all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leah, nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;Patty,
if you can&rsquo;t cut out a little black-eyed beauty,
you&rsquo;re no good! Don&rsquo;t submit so tamely! Go
to Washington,&mdash;hunt up the horrid little
thing, and see what she&rsquo;s like! Then, I&rsquo;ll back
your beauty against her, any day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush up, Bumble! Do you suppose I&rsquo;d
stoop to get back a man who has thrown me
over! You must be crazy! I love Bill Farnsworth,&mdash;I
adore him, and I can never love anybody
else; but I&rsquo;ll never raise a finger to
whistle him back! I&rsquo;m not that sort of a girl!
I shall never write him again, or refer to this
miserable business in any way. I&rsquo;m glad Mr.
Herron gave me the hint, or I might have made
a fool of myself; now, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan was re-reading the unlucky missive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; was her comment. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t understand it. There is no mistaking his
handwriting; there&rsquo;s no mistaking the words of
that silly verse! But I don&rsquo;t like it, Patty.
I&rsquo;m surprised at Bill. If he had ceased to love
you, why not tell you so, like a gentleman?
You know, I always said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Nan!&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s voice was tense,
while red spots burned on her cheeks, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you dare cast any reflection on him! My
Billee is all right! He <i>is</i> a gentleman! I laid
myself open to this treatment and I deserved
all I&rsquo;ve got. It was bad taste to say the least,
for me to send that thing! I never should have
done it, but to get more money for the committee.
I was thoughtless, careless, and foolishly
unwilling to let Mr. Herron think I didn&rsquo;t
dare send it. He said &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t dare take the
chance!&rsquo; meaning that I might get back&mdash;just
what I did get back! But I was so <i>sure</i> of
Bill&rsquo;s love, so confident of his faith and loyalty,
that I never dreamed there was a chance of Mr.
Herron&rsquo;s being right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t right!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;I believe
there&rsquo;s a mistake somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where?&rdquo; asked Patty, listlessly. &ldquo;If
you can invent or imagine something that would
explain his returning that horrid old thing, tell
me! I&rsquo;ll be glad to know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Helen couldn&rsquo;t think of any plausible or
even possible explanation or excuse for the return
of the valentine.</p>
<p>For Farnsworth was <i>not</i> a practical joker, and
indeed, few lovers could have been capable of
such a jest as that!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The case seemed to be at a deadlock. It was
incredible that Little Billee should have sent
back the valentine, yet, there it was! And indubitably
from him. There was no possibility
that any one else had written Patty&rsquo;s address on
the big envelope. Bill&rsquo;s large, well-formed
chirography was characteristic and unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; confessed Patty,
&ldquo;Bill thinks I opened a letter that he sent me,
sealed. And I didn&rsquo;t. Maybe that made him
stop loving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flower-face was so pathetic in its tragic
grief, that Nan waxed wroth again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if Bill Farnsworth has
really tossed you off like a discarded glove, I
think Fred Fairfield will reckon with him! It&rsquo;s
outrageous,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Nan; don&rsquo;t let Father do anything
sensational! I don&rsquo;t want a man who doesn&rsquo;t
want me! I assure you I don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m no meek
Griselda&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the patient one,&rdquo; put in Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not patient, either! I&rsquo;m&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m
just miserable! I wish you would both clear
out, and let me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nan, determinedly.
&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we are going to do.
You dress yourself all up and we&rsquo;ll all go down
town and lunch at the gayest and giddiest place
we can find, and then we&rsquo;ll go to a foolish
matin&eacute;e,&mdash;the most hilarious one there is on the
boards,&mdash;and then, we&rsquo;ll get a new start, and
when we come home we can talk this over with
your father, and see what&rsquo;s what in the Fairfield
household!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty demurred, saying she didn&rsquo;t want to go,
but Nan was inexorable, and at last Patty
yielded. But only on the condition that they
would give her half an hour alone first, to
think things out.</p>
<p>This was granted, and Patty was left alone
and undisturbed for the stipulated time.</p>
<p>When Nan came again to the room, she found
Patty not yet dressing, but looking far more
cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thinked it out,&rdquo; she greeted Nan; &ldquo;and
here&rsquo;s the result. I&rsquo;m going to keep faith in my
Little Billee, until he tells me with his own lips
that he&rsquo;s tired of me, and loves another girl.
I can&rsquo;t see any way to hope this isn&rsquo;t so, but
I&rsquo;m going to keep my faith, till I know more,&mdash;anyway.
Because, Nan,&rdquo; her voice fell to a
whisper, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go crazy! When I
remember all he has said to me,&mdash;all his faith
in me, all his protestations of undying, unfailing
love, I can&rsquo;t <i>believe</i> it&rsquo;s all swept away by
some new face! Think how long Bill has cared
for me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Patty, look at it like that. It&rsquo;s
a whole lot better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Nan, too, had thought it
over very seriously, and she could see no explanation
but Bill Farnsworth&rsquo;s deep perfidy.
She could conceive of no theory that would fit
the facts, save the hint that Herron had
dropped, that Bill had been enslaved by a
sparkling little brunette, full of the Southern
charm and fascination.</p>
<p>It was not like Farnsworth, but Nan realised
that men are not always masters of their
fates.</p>
<p>She carried out her plan, and took the two
girls to luncheon and then to the theatre, and
she was glad to see that Patty&rsquo;s poise had returned
to her, and though not exactly cheerful,
she was at least, calm and composed.</p>
<p>Whether this was due to the gay entertainment,
or to her avowed faith in her recreant
lover, Nan didn&rsquo;t know. But she was glad that
Patty was outwardly pleasant and placid, whatever
might be the turmoil in her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>They returned home about six o&rsquo;clock, and
as they entered, Jane, the housemaid, told Patty
there had been a long-distance telephone call
for her, during the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whoever it was,&rdquo; Jane said, &ldquo;promised
to call you again later,&mdash;at half-past six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Patty, her heart bounding
with hope that the call might be from Washington.
But it was improbable, for owing to
the difficulties and delays in getting a good connection,
Bill rarely could take time for this
method of communication.</p>
<p>Still outwardly serene, she went to her room
and took off her wraps, and then returned to
the library to await the expected call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it will be Bill,&rdquo; said Helen,
comfortingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Patty returned, drearily,
and then she waited.</p>

<br />LENA AND BILL</h2>
<p>To get the right view of certain matters,
let us go back a few days, and transport
ourselves to Washington.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth of February, Captain Farnsworth
was busily engaged at his desk work,
when Lena Richards came flying in at his doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold!&rdquo; she cried, by way of forestalling
his objections to her presence; &ldquo;I <i>must</i>
talk to somebody, and it might as well be <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might as well be the President of the
United States, and all his Cabinet, as far as
I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; and Farnsworth scowled at
her, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather you&rsquo;d choose anybody than
my unworthy self! What shall I do with you,
Lena? You&rsquo;re a little nuisance! Must I lock
and bar the door to keep you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t be cross to a poor little
lonesome girlie, what hasn&rsquo;t got anybody to
consult. Lemme ask you a few questions, do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Lena was a wheedlesome creature, and quite
in the habit of having her own way. She
laughed at Bill&rsquo;s frown and as she plumped
herself down in an armchair, she spread out
on Farnsworth&rsquo;s desk a number of gay
valentines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;is for Dick Selden.
Isn&rsquo;t it a dandy! And this one is for my own
Daddy. Won&rsquo;t he be surprised to get one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena chuckled happily, and looked up into
Bill&rsquo;s face for a show of approval.</p>
<p>She seemed only a child; her sixteen years sat
lightly on her slim little shoulders, and her
dark, winsome face was lighted with such a
glow of happy anticipation, that good-natured
Farnsworth couldn&rsquo;t bear to speak shortly to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Baby,&rdquo; he said, good-humouredly,
&ldquo;show me your valentines, and get it over with.
Which one is for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that I haven&rsquo;t here! Of course I
wouldn&rsquo;t show you that one!&rdquo; A merry laugh
rippled from the rosy lips. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll send
me one, won&rsquo;t you, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of doing so. In
fact, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of sending any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! Not to your sweetheart? Not to
that lovely angel-faced girl whose pictures are
all about here? I&rsquo;m ashamed of you! What
<i>will</i> she think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth suddenly realised his defection.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll forgive me. Patty will
understand. She knows I&rsquo;m terribly busy&mdash;more
than busy,&mdash;I&rsquo;m all in a moil, and working
night and day to straighten it out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Captain! That isn&rsquo;t enough to excuse
not sending a valentine to the girl of your
heart! Whee! If I were engaged to a man,
and if he didn&rsquo;t send me a valentine! I&rsquo;d break
that engagement so quick he wouldn&rsquo;t know
what hit him! Fie, fie, Captain! You&rsquo;re a
peach of a lover, you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena had risen and was dancing about the
room. A restless elf, she rarely sat still long,
and loved to fly about, looking at things here
and there, poking and prying curiously into
books or papers, and really bothering the life
out of Farnsworth. Many times he had concluded
to move to other quarters, where he
might be free from her interruptions, but this
house suited him so well otherwise, and, too,
he was so busy, he disliked to take the necessary
time to make the change.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>But Lena&rsquo;s accusation gave his big, true heart
a thrill. Was he really negligent of Patty?
His own Posy-face Patty,&mdash;whom he loved
with all his great soul! He knew he was not a
society man, not much of an observer of the
lighter conventions, and he wondered if Patty
would expect a valentine from him, and be disappointed
at not receiving it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send her some flowers,&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;I can telegraph a florist in New York and
have them delivered tomorrow,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
day, isn&rsquo;t it, Lena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but flowers are so&mdash;so impersonal, and
careless. You ought to send her a real valentine.
Here, you can have one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I? Really! Oh, you dear little girl!
That would help a lot,&mdash;for I haven&rsquo;t time to
go out to the shops. Let me take your prettiest
one, and I&rsquo;ll pay you what it cost, and you can
buy another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Lena nodded her pretty
head. &ldquo;That goes! Now, I&rsquo;ve only one here
that I want to spare. This one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena held up a pretty looking affair. It had
a picture of an affectionate pair, leaning over
a rustic stile, and surrounded by hearts and
darts and Cupids and rose garlands.</p>
<p>The lines printed inside the leaf, were:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our love is high as Heaven</p>
<p class="t">And wide as rolling sea:</p>
<p class="t0">The vows cannot be riven</p>
<p class="t">That bind my love and me.</p>
<p class="t0">But should our pledge be broken</p>
<p class="t">Or should your love be dead,</p>
<p class="t0">Send back this tender token</p>
<p class="t">And let us never wed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Farnsworth looked at it carelessly. &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the only one available,
I&rsquo;ll have to take that one. It&rsquo;s all right,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a beauty! It cost a dollar,&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheap at the price!&rdquo; laughed Farnsworth,
taking out his pocketbook. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care such
a lot for the sentiment, however. The first
part is all right, but that second stanza is
ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, ridiculous? I think it&rsquo;s lovely! You
don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll send it back, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not! Our vows cannot be riven,&mdash;as
your poet hath it. But I could have made up
a better jingle myself! That&rsquo;s what I ought to
have done! Made a real valentine for my
sweetheart! Oh, I wish I weren&rsquo;t so over-worked!
Well, some day I&rsquo;ll make up to her
for this enforced neglect. Now, be off, Lena,
if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll pitch you out,&mdash;neck and
crop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, Captain; but I was going to
say if you&rsquo;d address your valentine, I&rsquo;d post it
along with mine. There&rsquo;s none too much time,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lena, you&rsquo;re a good little thing.
And I&rsquo;m a bear,&mdash;a cross one, sometimes, I
fear. Will you forgive me, and take my valentine
with yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I will. Write the directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Farnsworth dashed off Patty&rsquo;s name and
address on the big envelope, and Lena ran away
with it.</p>
<p>So, you see!</p>
<p>Of course, the valentine Bill sent Patty was
the counterpart of the one she sent him, and
when you know all, you&rsquo;ll find out that this
wasn&rsquo;t such a strange coincidence as it might
seem.</p>
<p>And of course, the valentine that Patty received,
and that caused her such paroxysms of
woe, was the one Lena mailed and <i>not</i> the
return of the one she had sent to Farnsworth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>It was a fine mixup, and Cupid, the little god
of Love, must have flown madly about in his dismay
and despair of ever getting it straightened
out.</p>
<p>Now, as is well known, the extra mail occasioned
by the observance of the festival of
St. Valentine, often causes delays in transmission.
Which explains why both these important
missives we&rsquo;re interested in, reached
their respective destinations a couple of days
after they were normally due.</p>
<p>And Patty, as we have seen, was pretty well
broken up over the receipt of hers! Naturally,
she supposed it to be the one she sent, returned
to her by Farnsworth, and no one could wonder
that she did think this.</p>
<p>And so, when Captain Farnsworth found in
his mail a big square envelope addressed in
Patty&rsquo;s well-known, well-loved handwriting,
he knew it for a valentine before he opened
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless her heart!&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Dear little girl to send me a valentine! And
I&rsquo;m jolly glad I sent her one! I must thank
that bothersome little Lena for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the envelope, and to his astonishment,
he drew out what seemed to be the very
valentine he had sent Patty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried aloud, a puzzled frown
coming over his face.</p>
<p>He looked at it carefully; being exactly the
same, he naturally thought Patty had returned
his missive.</p>
<p>Bewildered, he read the lines, which he had
scarcely sensed as he hastily glanced them over
before sending.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Send back this tender token</p>
<p class="t">And let us never wed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Patty had sent it! Had returned his &ldquo;tender
token!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should your love be dead&rdquo;&mdash;was he, then,
to infer that Patty&rsquo;s love was dead? His
Patty! Never, in a million years! If ever a
girl was true blue, that girl was Patty Fairfield,&mdash;his
own Patty Blossom! There could be no
two opinions about that!</p>
<p>With a sudden jerk, he picked up the telephone
and called for New York.</p>
<p>It took a long time to get the connection, and
Captain Farnsworth grew more and more impatient.
He did not storm at the operator,
that was not his way. He patiently waited
&ldquo;just a minute,&rdquo; till scores of minutes flew by,
and at last he heard Jane&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>No, Miss Patty was not at home; she would
be home about six. He would call up again?
Very well. Good-bye.</p>
<p>Farnsworth strode up and down his room. It
was only half-past three, he would call her
about half-past six. Meantime&mdash;he must
work. But the big man couldn&rsquo;t settle himself
to work. The thing was so inexplicable, so
disturbing. Had Patty meant it for a joke?
Had she meant to tease him? If so it was a
bit of bad taste,&mdash;and Patty was never guilty
of bad taste. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it at
all.</p>
<p>He tried to make out his reports, and of
course, he succeeded in doing so, but it was a
process greatly interrupted by long periods of
distracted thought.</p>
<p>Suppose Patty really meant it! Bosh!
Meant it! His Patty? Never! He would
believe anything but that! Could it have been
a mistake? Did she slip his valentine in an
envelope which she had addressed to him for
the purpose of sending another one,&mdash;and then
she had mixed them up?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>No; Patty was never careless, and least of all,
where he was concerned. She was efficient,
always, and he had had too much correspondence
with her not to know how careful
she was. And then, came to his mind dark
thoughts of Philip Van Reypen.</p>
<p>Suppose,&mdash;just <i>suppose</i>, Patty had found that
she preferred Phil to himself,&mdash;could she have
chosen a better or more definite way to tell
him so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should your love be dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man writhed at the thought. He put
it out of his mind as unworthy of him and unworthy
of his love. And yet, that would explain
it,&mdash;and what else would? What else
could? But that explanation he refused to
accept. Patty, his own gentle dear little Patty,
he wouldn&rsquo;t be cruel,&mdash;but&mdash;if she had such a
thing to tell him, she would choose some way
that seemed to her the least cruel&mdash;he knew
that!</p>
<p>Was she using his means&mdash;as he had unwittingly
given her the chance,&mdash;oh, why <i>had</i> he
sent that foolish thing? It was silly,&mdash;it was
absurd,&mdash;it was bad taste on his part!</p>
<p>But Lena had brought it, and it had seemed to
him silly, but harmless.</p>
<p>He worried and fretted, fumed and scowled,
but he could come to no satisfactory conclusion
or explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>He looked at his watch until he almost wore
it out, only to find each time that but a moment
or two had elapsed.</p>
<p>At last he gave up trying to work and went
out for a walk.</p>
<p>The clear cold air freshened his brain but his
heart still had a dull, queer ache in it. He did
a few errands, forcing himself to concentrate
his mind in their accomplishment, and at last
the slow-going clock-hands crawled around to
half-past six.</p>
<p>Back in his own rooms, Bill called New York
again, and asked for Patty&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p>The connection was a good one, and he finally
heard the well-beloved voice say, &ldquo;Hello,&mdash;Little
Billee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty!&rdquo; he cried, explosively, &ldquo;oh,
Patty Blossom! When will you marry me?
What day? Tell me, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;you sent back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t send back anything!
Never mind that fool valentine business!
Answer my question, quick! Sometimes they
snap off the connection, and if they did <i>that</i> I&rsquo;d
go wild! <i>When</i>, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;oh&mdash;any time! Bill, dear,&mdash;any
time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, darling! But what day? what
date? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can! Now,&mdash;and make it soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say in October&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October your grandmother! Say April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Bill, I can&rsquo;t! And this is no
thing to decide over a telephone! You come
up here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&mdash;not for a few days, and I&rsquo;ve got
to know this thing now,&mdash;see? NOW!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say June, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! you may say May, but not a day later.
Say your birthday, that&rsquo;s in May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May&rsquo;s an unlucky month&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for us,&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be! On your birthday,
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bill, what made you return
my valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you return mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t! Oh, Patty, I see it,&mdash;it has just
dawned on me! We sent duplicates! Where&rsquo;d
you get yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a bazaar thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see; and I got mine from&mdash;well,&mdash;I
got it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter now. I bought it and paid for
it; and they chanced to be just alike! Puzzle
it out at your leisure. Now, Posy-face, I&rsquo;m
coming to New York just as soon as I can
manage it, but it may be a week or so,&mdash;I
hope not, I hope to get there in a couple of
days, but all I can say is, I&rsquo;ll do the best I
can, and you begin to get ready for that May
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not May, Bill&mdash;June!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why? <i>why</i> not May? Well, wait till I
see you, and perhaps I can persuade you to say
May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see, but I refuse to decide it over
a telephone! Nobody <i>ever</i> did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if that mattered! Well, you get busy
with your preparations, and we&rsquo;ll see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you must say good-bye, dear. You
know this is long distance and not a local
call!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it is! Tell me something,&mdash;Patty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you <i>that</i> at long distance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and if I hear your voice without seeing
you, much longer, I&rsquo;ll go off my head! Good-bye,
then, you darling, Patty Blossom,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee! Don&rsquo;t! Somebody&rsquo;ll
hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em! Good-bye, dearest,&mdash;my Best
Beloved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty hung up the receiver, and sat very still,
her eyes shining like two big blue stars.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t quite straightened out the valentine
mixup in her mind yet, but she didn&rsquo;t care! It
was all right! Little Billee loved her just the
same as ever,&mdash;if not more! And she had
promised to marry him in June! It was a
sudden step. She had realised she was engaged
to him,&mdash;and would marry him some day; but
she never had, even in her own mind, set any
definite date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Helen, coming in, &ldquo;I discreetly
stayed out, while you were telephoning, now I
think I might be told if the call <i>was</i> from
Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; answered Patty; &ldquo;it most certainly
was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not crying as torrentially as you
were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; and Patty smiled like a Chessy
cat. &ldquo;In fact, I think I may assure you I shall
never cry again; at least, not if I continue to
feel as happy as I do at this present speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, my fairy cousin! Now,&mdash;tell
old Bumble all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Patty told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things! Do you mean that he,
just by chance, sent you a valentine exactly like
the one you sent him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I suppose they&rsquo;re all over. You
know every year there&rsquo;s some funny or clever
one that has a vogue everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer, for him to select that for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, but I don&rsquo;t care! He did, and I did,
so we can&rsquo;t blame each other. But I was the
baddy one, because I distrusted him! He
hadn&rsquo;t a doubt of me! When he,&mdash;as he supposed,&mdash;got
back the one he sent me, he called
up and asked me to set our wedding-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he, really? Oh, Patty, that&rsquo;s the sort
of a man to marry! I always did like him,
now I think he&rsquo;s just perfectly stunning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too, and I&rsquo;m ashamed of my doubts
and fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, he&rsquo;ll never know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will, I shall tell him. And maybe
he&rsquo;ll be so disappointed in me, and so hurt,
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;ll break off the engagement! Oh,
yes! Oh, certainly! Patty, you are a goose,
and always will be! Never let him know what
a goose you are, or he sure will throw you
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not!&rdquo; Patty smiled happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when is the day? What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say positively,&mdash;but, oh, Bumble,
he&rsquo;s so impatient!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is! Any real lover would be,
and especially any one who is expecting to
marry Patty Fairfield!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT</h2>
<p>Patty was walking up and down the
library, waiting for Little Billee. He
had written and he had telegraphed and
he had telephoned, and every message changed
or contradicted the previous one, and Patty was
nervous.</p>
<p>She flew from one chair to another, she flung
herself on the davenport, and back to the
window-seat; she pulled aside the curtains and
stared down the street, in fact, she flew around,
Bumble declared, like a hen with her head off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly, if you like, Patty,&rdquo; Nan said, kindly;
&ldquo;it may help some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock, and she had expected Bill
momentarily since one. And at last she saw
him! The big man came swinging round a
corner and looking up, saw Patty&rsquo;s face at the
window.</p>
<p>He paused at the sight, and the two stood,
beaming at each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there he is!&rdquo; Nan cried. &ldquo;Come,
Bumble, let&rsquo;s leave them to themselves for a
few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few hours!&rdquo; Patty called out, as the two
slipped from the room, and then Farnsworth
came in.</p>
<p>He found a Patty smiling with joy, not nervous
now, but a lovely shining-eyed girl, with
welcoming arms outstretched and a soft flush
tinting her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blossom Girl!&rdquo; he cried, and then he
clasped her in a big whole-souled embrace, that
nearly swept her off her feet.</p>
<p>Close he held her, in a happy silence, then he
gently lifted the flower-face and kissed the
quivering lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dearest, my Best Beloved, I thought
I&rsquo;d never get here! The trains crawled, the
waits were interminable! But I&rsquo;m here, and
I have you in my arms and nothing else
matters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear thing!&rdquo; Patty said, timidly reaching
up to caress his strong, firm chin with her
little fingers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten you&rsquo;re so&mdash;so
enormous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth&rsquo;s laugh rang out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> a lot of me, isn&rsquo;t there? But I&rsquo;m
all yours, so you must get used to seeing me
round. Would you rather I were less enormous,
Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! I wouldn&rsquo;t have you changed
in any respect! You&rsquo;re just right! But you
make me feel small!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are. My little Patty <i>Petite</i>. I&rsquo;m
glad, too, &rsquo;cause I like you much better this
way. You see, I can pick you up and put you
wherever I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth picked Patty up like a child, and
placed her on the big davenport, then sat down
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m happy! Can we sit here forever,&mdash;or
do we have to be ordinary citizens and
chum with the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll let us alone a little while, and then
I s&rsquo;pect Nan and Bumble will come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I hoped I&rsquo;d have you all to
myself. Can&rsquo;t we send them to a matin&eacute;e, or
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for that. Here they come now,
Little Billee! Take your arm away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t! They know you&rsquo;re mine, and I&rsquo;ve
a perfect right to have my arm round
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t done! It isn&rsquo;t conventional!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;I make my own conventions! Hello,
Bumble! How d&rsquo;you do, Mrs. Fairfield?
Excuse this small parcel I hold in my left arm,
but I can&rsquo;t let go of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth&rsquo;s bonny smile was so glad and gay
that Nan smiled in sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Patty, and she cuddled contentedly
in Big Bill&rsquo;s outstretched arm, as they
returned to the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Farnsworth explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
the dickens of a time to get away at all, and
everything interfered and detained me. I can
only stay a few hours,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Patty, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going right
back? Tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear; I&rsquo;m on a big mission,&mdash;two big
missions, in fact, one connected with my country
and one with my sweetheart. I try not to let
them get mixed up,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s difficult to give
undivided attention to either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you come for,&rdquo; demanded Patty,
&ldquo;if you have to go right away again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came, my child, to make sure you will name
a certain date, that will be to me, the most
momentous in American history. I must get
<i>that</i> settled before I go to work in earnest to
help win the war! And you said you couldn&rsquo;t
do it over the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;This way is nicer,&rdquo; and Patty nestled against
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For bare-faced love-makers, you two are
pretty outspoken,&rdquo; commented Bumble, smiling
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse!&rdquo; said Patty, without moving.
&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t under ordinary conditions, but
realise, please, that our love-making has to be
done when we can get a chance,&mdash;which is awful
seldom. If you don&rsquo;t want to play audience,&mdash;there
is another course open to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> run away!&rdquo; and
Bumble settled down to stay. &ldquo;I want to
hear all the plans and arrangements,&mdash;and oh,
Patty, when is the day to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cornered, I see, and I suppose I may as
well decide now as any time. Let&rsquo;s say June&mdash;about
the middle of June. How&rsquo;s that, Little
Billee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next best to May, if you can&rsquo;t be ready for
May. How about the first of June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;long about the middle or latter part
I&rsquo;ve a heap to do. I can&rsquo;t get married without
a lot of embroidered linen things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have a shower!&rdquo; cried Bumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I don&rsquo;t want a shower! I
mean really lovely things,&mdash;all hand-embroidered,&mdash;oh,
Little Billee, shall we live in a
<i>house</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I had supposed so,&mdash;but if you prefer
a tree&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I mean a house or an apartment, or
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Agnes! <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know. Live
wherever you like,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll live there too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Farnsworth looked
suddenly serious. &ldquo;It all depends on the war
developments, Patty. I may have to go to
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps you can&rsquo;t,&mdash;it will be on a special
mission&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears came to Patty&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Whatever your
country calls you to do, you must do, of course,&rdquo;
she said, slowly, &ldquo;but if you go to France and
leave me here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&mdash;so there,
now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may not come to that,&rdquo; Farnsworth
sighed a little wearily; &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t cross the
bridge until we come to it. You go ahead as
fast as you can, embroidering your tidies and
tablespreads, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t embroider them. I&rsquo;ll have
them done,&mdash;in the trousseau shops,&mdash;oh, they
will be lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You goose!&rdquo; cried Bumble. &ldquo;I believe you
think more of your trousseau than of your
husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty made no answer to this, save a flashing
glance at Farnsworth, which seemed to assure
him that Bumble&rsquo;s notion was a mistaken one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the valentines,&rdquo; Nan said,
&ldquo;however did you come to get one just like
Patty&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it queer?&rdquo; assented Bill. &ldquo;And, if
you ask me, I think they were silly, stupid
things, anyway! How&rsquo;d <i>you</i> come to get it,
Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a dare,&rdquo; Patty laughed. &ldquo;Lieutenant
Herron&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my new army friends. Oh, Little
Billee, I&rsquo;ve so much to tell you, and no time to
tell it in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! and first of all, I must ask you
if you opened a sealed note before I told you
you might.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Patty&rsquo;s blue eyes met Farnsworth&rsquo;s
blue ones with a gaze of unmistakable
honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t, of course,&rdquo; he said, perplexedly,
&ldquo;but the trouble is, who did? Somebody
must have done so, to know that I thought
of coming up to New York. It was important
that it shouldn&rsquo;t be known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could have done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pocket of my fur stole: that has a
most secure clasp-button, and I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t
meddled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty!&rdquo; cried Bumble, &ldquo;you know that spy
thing, who dressed up as a woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Farnsworth.</p>
<p>Eagerly Patty and Bumble together told the
story of the missing chaperon and the masquerading
pastry-cook.</p>
<p>Farnsworth looked very grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spy, undoubtedly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;in Herron&rsquo;s
employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not Lieutenant Herron! Why, he&rsquo;s
one of our own soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Patty. And you, too, Helen.
Never mention the subject to any human being.
Much depends on that. I can trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; vowed both girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I do wrong, dear?&rdquo; asked Patty,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not knowingly, sweetheart; but you must be
very careful. I use you as my little helper, but
if it is known, I must not do it. Now, Patty,
here is another paper, that I want to leave in
your care for a couple of days. Hide it as
carefully as you can, and when I tell you to,
then, mail it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and Patty took the letter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put
it in this desk, now,&mdash;see, it has a secret compartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty went to an antique mahogany desk, and
in sight of them all, she secreted the important
document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably all right,&rdquo; and Farnsworth
sighed with relief. &ldquo;I was a bit fidgetty about
having it in my pockets any longer. Now,
don&rsquo;t touch that desk, or open the secret drawer
until I tell you to post the packet. Somebody
might see you poking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are no spies here, Billee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are everywhere. No place is surely
safe from them. Don&rsquo;t worry, or even think
about them. But just obey orders, unquestioningly,
like the loyal little patriot you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right; just as you say,&rdquo; and Patty smiled
at her commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; Bumble cried, and
Fred Fairfield came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Farnsworth! Well, but I&rsquo;m glad to
see you! You&rsquo;re looking fine, barring a deep
line of care and responsibility that has furrowed
itself into your brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right, especially now that I&rsquo;m
back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home it is, my boy. You&rsquo;re a pretty big
order for a son, but I&rsquo;m all ready to adopt
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad, give me fatherly advice
when needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then to Farnsworth&rsquo;s deep regret, Philip
Van Reypen came to call.</p>
<p>The two men met courteously and were outwardly
calm, but in each heart rankled a distaste
of the other.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was absurd, but Farnsworth was
jealous of Philip, and though confident of
Patty&rsquo;s love and loyalty, he hated to think of
Van Reypen in New York while he must be
in Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>As to Philip, he was frankly envious of Little
Billee, and moreover, was determined to cut
him out and regain Patty for himself if it could
possibly be done. Phil was not dishonourable,&mdash;at
least, he didn&rsquo;t think he was,&mdash;for he
deemed all fair in love and war.</p>
<p>But Captain Farnsworth was very glad when
he learned that Van Reypen must of necessity
be in Wilmington almost all the time. To be
sure, his leave of absence seemed to occur very
often, but after all he didn&rsquo;t really live in New
York now, and that cheered Little Billee&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you fly with me?&rdquo; Van Reypen
asked of Patty, and he purposely gave his question
a sentimental flavour that startled Farnsworth
by its implication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till you&rsquo;re an experienced airman,&rdquo; returned
Patty, gaily, and then Bill realised what
was meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty!&rdquo; he said, severely, &ldquo;you are <i>never</i>
to go in an aeroplane,&mdash;I forbid it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke far more sternly, even harshly than
he meant to, for the bare idea of her so risking
her life appalled him, and with the added awfulness
of her going up with Van Reypen, Little
Billee felt indeed aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Patty, pouting a little; &ldquo;oh, but
I want to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Understand? It is an order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The positiveness of Farnsworth&rsquo;s commands
was quite softened by the sweetness of his tone,
but Patty was perverse, and she replied, &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you will, dear,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll promise because
I ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth stepped nearer to her, and with
one hand raised her chin until her gaze met his.
His strong, loving glance conquered, and won
by the deep love she saw in his eyes, Patty said,
simply, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and Bill smiled at her,
needing no reiteration or reassurance. Her
simple word was sufficient.</p>
<p>Van Reypen said nothing, but he gave Patty
a quizzical glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; she replied to his insinuation.
&ldquo;I love to be bossed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty, don&rsquo;t lose your wilfulness,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
one of your charms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more. You don&rsquo;t know, Phil, how
an engaged girl loves to be told what she may
and what she may not do. And, incidentally,
I&rsquo;ve no desire to break my neck before my wedding-day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d take you flying until I
was sure of my own powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powers are not all of it,&rdquo; Farnsworth said,
&ldquo;accidents are unavoidable, even in the best
regulated airships. But that matter is settled.
How do you like the air game, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top notch! I was cut out for an aviator,&mdash;I
feel it. There&rsquo;s no sport like it! Though
I don&rsquo;t take it exactly as a sport. I&rsquo;m making
a very serious business of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! That&rsquo;s the way to talk.
Now, people and friends, I&rsquo;m going to ask you
all to go away from this place and let me have
a little time alone with Patty, or else, stay here
and let us go somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty gasped at this high-handed suggestion,
but was truly pleased, for she hated to have
Farnsworth and Van Reypen together, and too,
she wanted to see Little Billee alone.</p>
<p>Nan, always helpful, hustled them all out to
another room, and left the lovers in possession
of the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is splendid,&rdquo; said Bumble as they went
to the family sitting-room. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look
fine in uniform!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; agreed Van Reypen, who was not
at all petty, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a fine old chap. And, after
yours truly, I don&rsquo;t know any one more worthy
of our Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both so splendid,&rdquo; said Bumble, with
a flattering glance, &ldquo;I should think Patty would
feel &lsquo;how happy could I be with either, were
t&rsquo;other dear charmer away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I hope,&rdquo; declared Phil, who
made no secret of his wishes regarding Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re both away most of the time.
I&rsquo;m going away too, tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. To visit a friend in East Ninety-fifth
Street. She invited me for a week, but
I&rsquo;m only going to stay a couple of days,&mdash;unless
I like it very much, then I might stay longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I take you there? When are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, thank you. Nan will send me, of
course. I go tomorrow afternoon. Patty
won&rsquo;t miss me, she&rsquo;s so busy ordering linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How she does love pretty things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she does! She&rsquo;s just the one to get
married, if only to get up a trousseau. Me,
when I&rsquo;m married, I won&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ve
any worldly goods or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never do, anyhow, do you?&rdquo; said Nan,
laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Meantime, Patty was discussing great and important
matters with Farnsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave all plans and arrangements to you,&rdquo;
he was saying; &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s the bride&rsquo;s
prerogative anyhow, but I&rsquo;m really ignorant of
such matters. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather just be
married to you, and run away from everybody,&mdash;without
any bells on,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s as you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Pauline! Little Patty has to have
a wedding, as is a wedding! Not an awful big
crowd and not a gorgeous pageant, but a nice
sweet pretty home wedding, with lots of white
satin ribbons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tied onto trunks and things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Of course, not that! I mean
aisles of it, and white stanchions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florists&rsquo; posts to hold up the garlands that
make the aisle through which your bride shall
come to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty Blossom! When you say those
things you do look so sweet! How can I wait
till June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the time will just fly! By the way, dear,
<i>why</i> can&rsquo;t I go up in a flying machine? Everybody
does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the majority of them come down
with broken bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not the majority!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a large minority, then. But, that
matter is settled, dearest, once for all. You&rsquo;re
not to do it, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I forbid it. Is that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that isn&rsquo;t quite enough! Here&rsquo;s the
real reason why!&rdquo; Patty smiled and whispered,
&ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty Precious! How happy you make me
when you&rsquo;re sweet and docile like that. Of
course you know it&rsquo;s my love for you that makes
me forbid your risking your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. Little Billee, wasn&rsquo;t it funny
about those valentines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it was. What did you mean by a
dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that! Lieutenant Herron said I
wouldn&rsquo;t dare send it to you, lest you send it
back! And I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t, and so I
dared! And then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you thought I did! Oh, you <i>dear</i>
little goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking so at first. How
did you happen to get the one you sent?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, little Lena,&mdash;the youngster where I
live,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is she a little black-haired beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little black-haired witch! Yes, she&rsquo;s a
good-looking kiddy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen, I believe. What, jealous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no; but you don&rsquo;t like her much, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little nuisance! I&rsquo;d fly the coop,
only I&rsquo;m well fixed there and it&rsquo;s a bother to
move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you to send it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. She said I ought to send
you a valentine, and, honestly, Patty, I own up
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it! So, as she had some
extra ones I took one and paid her for it.
That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of funny,&mdash;and funny they should be
alike. You see, Mr. Herron practically forced
me to send mine, and this little girl made you
send yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no harm done, is there? It
didn&rsquo;t bother me when I received what might
seem to be a &lsquo;returned token.&rsquo; For I trust you,
Patty, my Blessing, and nothing could ever
make me believe you false or fickle unless you
told me so yourself. So never fear what they
call &lsquo;misunderstandings&rsquo; for I shall come
straight to you and make you understand!
That&rsquo;s the meaning, to my mind, of our faith
and trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear big Little Billee! That&rsquo;s the
meaning to my mind, too. And to my heart.
My whole love is yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till death do us part,&rdquo; Farnsworth added,
reverently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />HELEN&rsquo;S ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, <i>do</i> let me have my own way
for once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumble&rsquo;s flashing brown eyes looked
troubled, but determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know my way perfectly,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;The car can leave me at the concert and then
take you on to your meeting. Then after the
concert, I can hop into a taxicab and go right
up to Millicent&rsquo;s without a bit of trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could, of course, Helen, if you were
like other people. But you&rsquo;re so rattle-pated,
you&rsquo;d just as likely go down town as up,&mdash;and
find yourself at the Battery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, Nan, honest, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve
only to tell the driver 783 East Ninety-fifth
Street, and he&rsquo;ll take me right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forget the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write it on a card, and keep it in my
bag. I&rsquo;m not an infant, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, dear, if you think you won&rsquo;t
get lost. Telephone me as soon as you&rsquo;re
safely at your friend&rsquo;s, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. What time will you get home,
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six. But you see, Patty wants the car
at five&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&mdash;I know all about it, and that&rsquo;s
why I insist on carrying out my own plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sent your suitcase, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was part of my well-laid plan.
You must admit, Nan, I&rsquo;ve looked out for
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, Helen; and I consent, for I
can&rsquo;t see any way out of it. You see Patty is
on the reception committee, and she must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Helen had flown off to get ready, so Nan
turned to her own affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Patsy Poppet,&rdquo; Bumble cried, a
little later, as in coat and furs she looked in at
Patty&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sweet you look, angel child. Who sent
you the violets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did! And none to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you had ordered him not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have; oh, me, I can&rsquo;t have flowers from
admiring swains any more, at all, at all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re sorry, for I know
better. You haven&rsquo;t an idea in your head that
isn&rsquo;t simply and solely about Bill Farnsworth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! As bad as that?&rdquo; Patty
smiled a little absently, as she went on writing
a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re writing to him now,&mdash;I
know by the lovesick way you hold your head
on one side! And, moreover, my young friend,
if you don&rsquo;t get dressed pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll be
late for your party. It&rsquo;s &rsquo;most four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Bumble! I thought your
concert began at three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&mdash;but was I ever at the beginning of
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen calmly accepted her own chronic tardiness
as a foregone conclusion, and with a waved
farewell, she trotted off.</p>
<p>She was going to her friend&rsquo;s house for the
night, but she greatly desired to go to a concert
first, and owing to the different engagements of
Patty and Nan, it was inconvenient for the
Fairfield car to call for her after the performance.</p>
<p>But she was more than willing to go to her
friend&rsquo;s in a cab by herself, and she had the
address safely tucked away in her purse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>The concert was enthralling to Helen&rsquo;s music-loving
soul, and she deeply regretted that her
late coming had lost her so much enjoyment.</p>
<p>When it was over, she drifted slowly out with
the rest of the crowding audience, and reached
the curb, still quivering with the exaltation that
fine music always aroused in her.</p>
<p>In a sort of absent-minded way, she suddenly
realised that it was snowing hard,&mdash;very hard,
indeed. A young but vigorous blizzard had
set in, and though shielded by the marquise,
Helen found herself well covered with snowflakes.</p>
<p>She stepped up to the liveried man at the curb
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please call a taxi for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait your turn, Miss, there&rsquo;s
twelve ahead of you. This here unexpected
snowstorm makes cabs in great demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen saw that many others were more or less
patiently waiting and resigned herself to wait,
too.</p>
<p>Her mind turned back to the music, and she
drew out her programme to regret anew the
numbers she had missed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>A long time she stood there, studying the
names of the performers and their selections,&mdash;so
absorbed that she did not notice the deepening
dusk, the thickening snowflakes and the
rapidly rising wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fierce, Miss,&rdquo; the starter said to her, at
last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get you that cab the very
minute I can,&mdash;but I dunno when &rsquo;twill be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Bumble, looking up. &ldquo;Oh,
yes,&mdash;I do want a cab. Why, how it is snowing!
Get one quick, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and the man looked honestly
anxious, for Helen had an irresponsible air and
the hour was growing late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you telephone for your own car,
Miss,&rdquo; he said, by way of a hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t, Patty wants it,&mdash;I mean,&rdquo; she
suddenly realised where she was. &ldquo;I mean, the
others of the family need our car. I must have
a cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss, I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no use,&rdquo; the man told her a few
minutes later. &ldquo;I mean there ain&rsquo;t no telling
when I can get you a taxi; but here&rsquo;s a hansom
cab, don&rsquo;t you think now, you&rsquo;d better take
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? A hansom? Oh, I never do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Ma&rsquo;am, but it&rsquo;s a chance, and you
might have to wait a lot longer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, perhaps it would be the best
thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re lucky to get me,&rdquo; observed the
driver from his high perch, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t many
vacant cabs tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starter put Helen into the little vehicle,
tucked the robe about her, and closed the doors,
with a feeling of relief at seeing the young lady
<i>en route</i> for home. Then, before he had the
glass lowered he asked for the address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and Helen opened her bag.
&ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a hasty and fluttering search failed to
produce the written paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I must have
jerked it out with my programme. Won&rsquo;t you
look around on the pavement, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man obligingly looked, but the snow had
fallen so thickly, that there was no sign of the
lost paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;I know the
number. It&rsquo;s 783 West Ninety-fifth Street. I
remember, because it&rsquo;s the same number as
some one&rsquo;s house in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure. And it&rsquo;s on the third floor.
My friend told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and the glass slid down, and the
hansom started uptown.</p>
<p>The progress was slow, for the street traffic
was enormous at that hour and greatly impeded
by the storm beside.</p>
<p>At last they turned into Central Park, and
Helen, looking out, thought that now their gait
would be a little faster.</p>
<p>But it was decidedly slower, and after a few
moments the driver opened the little trap in the
roof, and called down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make the Park, Ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;too
slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Helen, not at all comprehending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, the horse can&rsquo;t go through the Park.
The ice under the snow is too treacherous,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
fall down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotter go back out again, and get over to
Broadway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>It was all Greek to Helen, for she had no idea
of the position of the New York streets, and it
was now so dark that the lights glimmering
through the storm only made a more bewildering
outlook than ever.</p>
<p>She had no idea where she was, or where she
was going, but her optimistic nature felt no
fear, only annoyance at the elements.</p>
<p>Faster fell the snow, and slower went the
horse. He stumbled frequently, and almost fell
several times.</p>
<p>At last he did fall, and Helen was pitched
forward against the glass.</p>
<p>Luckily, it did not break, and as she crouched
in a heap, the driver reassured her from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit tight, Miss! We&rsquo;ll get him up. Don&rsquo;t
open the doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was thoroughly scared now, but her
good sense told her that to obey the driver&rsquo;s
advice was the best thing she could do.</p>
<p>And sure enough, after a time, with the help
of policemen and others, the horse was somehow
again on his feet and apparently uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re off,&rdquo; the cheery driver called
down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible storm, but I can get you
there, if we go slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slowly, then,&rdquo; Helen answered, greatly
reassured by his honest, kindly accents, &ldquo;but do
get there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>So they went on, now merely crawling, as the
poor horse cautiously picked his steps, and
now stopping altogether, as the traffic forced
them to.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s watch had stopped, because she had
forgotten to wind it. They passed few pedestal
clocks, and those she could not see for the whirling
flakes. She wanted to ask the driver how
late it was getting, but couldn&rsquo;t make him
hear.</p>
<p>So they kept on, and at last the cab drew up
to a curb and the driver got down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you was lucky to
have me,&mdash;you sure was! For, I see you was
young and didn&rsquo;t know New York at all hardly.
And I&rsquo;m mighty glad to get you here without
any broken bones,&mdash;I am that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen appreciated his solicitude for her welfare,
and though she well knew it was, in part,
a hint for a goodly fee above his regular fare,
she felt that he deserved it.</p>
<p>She paid him generously, and bade him good
night with courteous thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right, now?&rdquo; he asked, as he looked
at the brightly-lighted entrance of the apartment
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Helen, glancing at the number
to be sure it was 783. &ldquo;This is Ninety-fifth
Street, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night and thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hansom drove away through the storm
and as Helen approached the house, the door
was swung open by a liveried doorman.</p>
<p>She went in, smiling with gladness to be once
more indoors amid light and warm surroundings,
and going at once to the elevator, she
said, &ldquo;Third floor, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the maid who answered her ring at the
door of the apartment, she nodded pleasantly,
and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Barlow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she looked around for her friend, Millicent
Wheeler.</p>
<p>But she saw no sign of her, and instead, a
strange lady came from one of the rooms, and
stared at Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said, politely but coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Miss Barlow,&rdquo; repeated Helen, &ldquo;to
see Mrs. Wheeler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wheeler? There is no such person in
this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Isn&rsquo;t this 783, Ninety-fifth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; are you looking for some friend?&rdquo;
The voice was kinder now, for Helen&rsquo;s was an
appealing personality, and she was evidently in
a quandary, but still the strange hostess did not
invite her guest to sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; oh, what can be the trouble? I&rsquo;m to
visit Mrs. Charles Wheeler, and her address is
this house,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m sure she said third floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Mrs. Wheeler in this house at
all, that I know of. You must have the wrong
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m sure of the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Helen Barlow, and I live in Philadelphia.
I&rsquo;m visiting friends in the city, and I&rsquo;m
to spend tonight with another friend. Oh, what
<i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you can do, but stay here
till morning. It&rsquo;s nearly eight o&rsquo;clock now,
and I can&rsquo;t send any one out in a storm like
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly eight! Oh, Nan will be crazy! She
<i>said</i> I&rsquo;d get lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady smiled. She was beginning to believe
Helen&rsquo;s story, though at first she had felt
wary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Lummis,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I live here
and have lived here a long time. I&rsquo;m sorry
for you, and I&rsquo;ll keep you over night. I won&rsquo;t
say, with pleasure, for as a matter of fact it
will put me out considerably. But I&rsquo;ve a little
too much humanity to turn you out in this
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen overlooked the coldness of the courtesy,
in her relief at having found a safe, if not
very hospitable shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I hate to put
anybody out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a question between putting me
out,&mdash;or, putting you out!&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Lummis, &ldquo;and I think it might as well be me.
Come into my little drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen followed her into a small but prettily
furnished room and Mrs. Lummis helped her
take off her wraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute, and we&rsquo;ll ferret out the
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostess took a telephone book from a
stand. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of the friend you&rsquo;re
after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wheeler, but she has a private wire.
You can&rsquo;t get her number. I had it but I lost
it, and Central positively refused to tell it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Again Mrs. Lummis looked a bit suspicious.
Then, with a whole-souled burst of enthusiasm,
she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if your story is fishy,&mdash;I
believe in you, and I won&rsquo;t ask you any more
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you think I&rsquo;m an impostor!&rdquo; Helen
exclaimed, the fact just dawning on her. &ldquo;Oh,
how <i>funny</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her laugh was so honest and so infectious that
Mrs. Lummis laughed too, and the two became
instant friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hate to intrude worse than ever, now,&rdquo;
declared Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind. It can&rsquo;t be helped. You
can have my room, and I&rsquo;ll bunk on the davenport.
I live alone, and&mdash;and I expected a few
friends this evening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. But I&rsquo;m no spoilsport. Just
tuck me into bed&mdash;oh, I wonder if I couldn&rsquo;t
go home&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She ran to the window and
looked out. &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s a regular blizzard!
And I <i>must</i> call up Nan! She&rsquo;ll be frantic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this Nan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lummis was a bit blunt, but she was
kindly now, and Helen replied, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s
where I&rsquo;m staying. Mrs. Fairfield. I know
her number, may I call her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll scare the wits out of her, if you tell
her you&rsquo;re in some strange house. But,&mdash;would
she send for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s such a storm! She&rsquo;d
probably say if I&rsquo;m safe under cover to stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell her then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know she&rsquo;ll worry. She told me, you
see, I&rsquo;d get lost,&mdash;and I did. I don&rsquo;t see how
it happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. You got the wrong house. That&rsquo;s
certain. Maybe the wrong number or street&mdash;oh,
say, didn&rsquo;t you want <i>East</i> Ninety-fifth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t know! Maybe I did! I
always forget that East or West matters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you little goose! <i>Why</i> did they let you
out alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said I oughtn&rsquo;t to come alone,&mdash;but I
begged so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s it. You wanted East and you
got West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go over East now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, no! It&rsquo;s across the Park!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t cross the Park. The horse tried,
and had to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see it all, now. And I&rsquo;ll take care
of you. Do you want to tell your Fairfield
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Helen considered. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tell them
that I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I mean,
I won&rsquo;t tell them what really has happened,&mdash;but
let them think for tonight that I&rsquo;m at Mrs.
Wheeler&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that look of suspicion crossed Mrs.
Lummis&rsquo; face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now stop!&rdquo; Helen laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
doing it to save them anxiety. Mrs. Fairfield
will worry all night, and my cousin will nearly
go crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you like. Then I&rsquo;ll give you
some supper and put you to bed, for I&rsquo;m telling
you frankly, I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> asking you to spend the
evening with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bustled away and Helen called up Nan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, Bumble, why didn&rsquo;t you
call sooner? I&rsquo;ve feared all sorts of things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, it&rsquo;s all right, Nan. I called you
as soon as I could get around to it. Good
night, now, I&rsquo;m in a hurry. Bye-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen hung up the receiver, knowing that
Nan couldn&rsquo;t call her back. Then, with her
usual acceptance of circumstances she shook off
all worry, and sat down to the pleasant little
supper Mrs. Lummis offered her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>And not long after, knowing that her hostess
so wished it, Helen suggested that she should
retire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you my room,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lummis, &ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll sleep well. You
must be pretty much exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; returned Helen, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a
lark! But don&rsquo;t fear, I won&rsquo;t intrude. Give
me a magazine or book to read, and I&rsquo;ll disappear
till morning. Lock me in, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and the lady laughed; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
afraid of your appearing at my party. Good
night, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A DESPERATE SITUATION</h2>
<p>Left to herself, Bumble thought over the
situation and laughed. As usual, she had
got into a scrape, and, also as usual, she
had fared very luckily.</p>
<p>Suppose instead of the kind Mrs. Lummis, she
had found a disagreeable hostess! But she had
fallen on her feet, and with her care-free nature
she bothered herself not a whit about unpleasant
possibilities.</p>
<p>She wandered about the pretty little bedroom,
feeling very grateful for the safe harbour from
the stormy night. She read a little, and then
sat at the well-furnished toilet table to take
down her hair.</p>
<p>She could hear guests arriving, and though of
no mind to eavesdrop, she could not help over-hearing
their light talk and chatter.</p>
<p>Helen was not curious by nature, and paid no
attention to the voices until the name of Lieutenant
Herron was mentioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>But then the voices were lowered, and she
caught no connected sentences.</p>
<p>A little ashamed of herself for listening at
all to talk not meant for her ears, Bumble went
to bed and was soon sound asleep.</p>
<p>Next morning Mrs. Lummis tapped at the
door, and entered cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep well, little girl? Yes? That&rsquo;s good.
Now for a bath and some breakfast, then I&rsquo;m
going to pack you off. Sorry to speed my parting
guest so hastily, but I have to go out of
town on an early train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen sprang out of bed, truly sorry to inconvenience
her kind benefactor.</p>
<p>She made especial haste with her dressing and
soon the two were seated at a cosy breakfast.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lummis asked a good many questions
and out of the kindness of her heart Helen
replied in full. Suddenly she realised that she
was divulging secrets. Without thinking, she
had told the story of the day at the Country
Club and the masquerading man, who, they
suspected, had surreptitiously opened the letter
that was in the pocket of Patty&rsquo;s fur stole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Mrs. Lummis was greatly interested, and
urged further details, and it was not until
Bumble had told of Bill&rsquo;s sometimes giving
Patty important letters to hide, that she bethought
herself of her indiscretion.</p>
<p>She had even told of the secret drawer in the
old desk, where Patty concealed the papers, and
the realisation of her mistake almost stunned
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell, will you?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I
oughtn&rsquo;t to have told that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden Mrs. Lummis&rsquo; eyes gleamed
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, a trifle absent-mindedly,
and rising abruptly she went to the
telephone.</p>
<p>She called a number and presently Helen
heard her talking in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Helen could understand no word, but she was
quick-witted and it seemed to her that Mrs.
Lummis was divulging important information
to some one exceedingly interested.</p>
<p>At last she caught what was, she felt sure, the
house number of the Fairfield home.</p>
<p>Frightened and appalled, she sat wondering
what she must do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>She had heard more or less spy talk, but she
knew nothing of such matters definitely. However
she felt she must warn Patty, and tell her
what she had inadvertently done. The horror
and regret of her deed was almost swallowed
up in the necessity for immediate action.</p>
<p>Helen was at her best in an emergency, and
her sometimes careless and blundering habits
didn&rsquo;t affect her mental efficiency. Her mind
worked rapidly and even while Mrs. Lummis
was talking, she was planning a way to circumvent
her.</p>
<p>At last the vivacious lady returned to the
table, with a murmured excuse for her lengthy
absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Bumble said, smiling,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to ask a similar indulgence.
May I telephone, please,&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve a bothersome
dressmaker&rsquo;s engagement that I want to
break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lummis, looking at her
shrewdly, &ldquo;but the telephone is out of order.
The storm, you know. Just as I finished talking,
it went dead, and we can&rsquo;t use it till it&rsquo;s
fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen knew this for an untruth, and a hastily
fabricated invention at that. But she saw that
Mrs. Lummis was not going to let her use the
telephone, and she felt her fears verified that
there was some secret work going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Mrs. Lummis then began chatting again, apparently
forgetful of her impending journey,
and as she adroitly led the talk to war matters
and around to Captain Farnsworth, Helen grew
more and more wary of what she said, and also
more and more determined to speak to Patty
without delay.</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, they rose, and went back
to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lummis sat in a high-backed chair, and
Bumble quickly formed her plan.</p>
<p>She drew from her coat pocket a long chiffon
veil or scarf, that she carried for cold weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so kind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to ask your acceptance of this as a little souvenir.
It&rsquo;s a Liberty scarf,&mdash;I bought it in
London,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s been little used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lummis, admiring
the silken fabric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s a real Liberty scarf,&mdash;to help
me to my liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Helen spoke, she quickly threw it around
Mrs. Lummis&rsquo; neck and then around the high
back of the chair, knotting it tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little villain!&rdquo; cried the victim, &ldquo;take
that off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; and Bumble pulled the knot
tighter. It did not hurt the prisoner, but it
made it impossible for her to rise from the
heavy, high-backed chair.</p>
<p>Helen quickly tied two or three more strong
knots in the long ends, and the firm silk fabric
was as secure as a hempen rope would have
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I guess that&rsquo;ll hold you!&rdquo; she said,
nodding approval at her work. Then, oblivious
to the venomous looks of the captive lady, she
took up the telephone and called Patty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re innocent of any wrong,&rdquo; she said
to Mrs. Lummis, as she waited for her
response, &ldquo;you can have no objection to my
speaking to my friends. Hello, that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mentioned no name but recognised Patty&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that little matter you put in the
Winthrop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Patty, knowing at once Bumble
meant the old Governor Winthrop desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out at once,&mdash;now,&mdash;and put it
somewhere else. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Bumble was nervously
impatient, but kept her voice calm, &ldquo;only
in the name of your country, do as I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; remove that to a place of safety,&mdash;absolute
safety. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s clear voice betokened her complete
comprehension, and Helen said no more.</p>
<p>Helen drew a sigh of relief as she hung up
the receiver.</p>
<p>She looked calmly at Mrs. Lummis. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;re doing what you consider your
duty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as I am doing mine. There&rsquo;s
no use of our quarrelling, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no desire to quarrel,&rdquo; the speaker was
quite evidently holding her temper under control
with difficulty, &ldquo;but I think this a most
unkind return for the hospitality I&rsquo;ve shown
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; and Helen laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
untie the baddy old scarf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still smiling, she untied the hard knots
behind the chair, taking her time for it,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may misjudge you entirely,&rdquo; she went on,
slowly, &ldquo;but sumpum tells me you&rsquo;ve used my
information to your own&mdash;or to some one&rsquo;s
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In-deed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lummis, looking at her
curiously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a clever youngster, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so clever as I wish I had been,&rdquo; and
Helen freed her captive entirely, and then
handed her the scarf, with an elaborate bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said, I beg your acceptance of this
souvenir of our little visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I accept in the spirit it is
offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, if you please, I&rsquo;ll get off, and you
may proceed on your interrupted journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll call a cab for you.&rdquo; Mrs.
Lummis sprang toward the telephone with such
alacrity, that Bumble intercepted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll call one. I know the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did so, and her hostess stood waiting, but
with a determined expression on her face, that,
Helen knew, betokened further planning.</p>
<p>Meantime, Patty, greatly amazed at Bumble&rsquo;s
telephone message, was acting upon the instructions.</p>
<p>She took the packet Farnsworth had confided
to her care from the old Winthrop desk and
thought deeply as to where she should hide it.</p>
<p>She had no idea what danger threatened, but
she knew from Helen&rsquo;s voice that it must be
something grave, and that the packet <i>must</i> be
safely concealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>It was a thick parcel,&mdash;an envelope so full of
folded papers that it was too bulky to place
between the leaves of a book, which was Patty&rsquo;s
first impulse.</p>
<p>She looked thoughtfully about. She mustn&rsquo;t
stand holding it! The danger, whatever it
was, might come at any minute. Helen&rsquo;s tone
commanded instant action.</p>
<p>A photograph album lay on a side table. This
was not usually in evidence, but Patty and
Helen had brought it from an old storeroom to
look at the old-fashioned portraits in it. It
was a large volume, holding pictures of &ldquo;cabinet
size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to a sudden inspiration, Patty
opened the album and extracted six of the
photographs. This left a hollow space quite
big enough to admit the insertion of the
envelope.</p>
<p>She put it in, clasped the big brass fastenings
of the old plush album, and laid it back on the
table, with two more books carelessly on top
of it.</p>
<p>She heard a ring at the door, and suspecting
trouble, she quickly tossed the six pictures she
held in a desk drawer, under some old papers.
She heard a few words in the hall, and then
Jane ushered in a man in khaki uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly, &ldquo;Miss
Fairfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Patty, with a courteously inquiring
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to intrude on your time; won&rsquo;t detain
you but a minute. I&rsquo;m Sergeant Colton, and
I&rsquo;m sent by Captain Farnsworth for the packet
he left with you for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Captain Farnsworth left no packet with
me for you,&rdquo; Patty returned. Her heart was
beating wildly, lest she commit some indiscretion,
and she prayed that she might do exactly
right in this emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, not by name.&rdquo; The man spoke
low, and glanced about him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret
mission. But I&rsquo;ve credentials and an order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket an official-looking
document, and showed Patty an order for the
envelope left with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t signed by Captain Farnsworth,&rdquo;
she said, examining it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he didn&rsquo;t dare sign it, it&rsquo;s a diplomatic
matter. But it is signed, as you see, by Colonel
Brent, and it is authoritative.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo;&mdash;Patty&rsquo;s voice was calm,
though her heart and nerves were in commotion,
&ldquo;but I have no parcel such as you
describe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a parcel,&mdash;a packet,&mdash;of papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is the difference between a parcel
and a packet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty smiled at him, for a gleam of threatening
intent in his eye convinced her it was better
to temporise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trifle, Miss Fairfield, this is your
country&rsquo;s business. I&rsquo;m sent by the administration
authorities for the envelope, and it is
your duty to hand it over, otherwise there may
be serious consequences&mdash;both to and because
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this order means nothing to me.&rdquo;
Patty stared blankly at the signed and stamped
document, that was so complicated of wording
and vague of intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re cautious.
Now, listen; Captain Farnsworth said you
might be wary about giving it up, and he told
me to tell you that he sent you the words
&lsquo;Apple Blossom&rsquo; as a talisman. He said if I
told you those words, you would know he sent
me. I suppose they are code words.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Patty stared at the man. It seemed to her
Bill must have sent him when he gave her such
a key word as that!</p>
<p>And yet, Patty was very wary of possible spies
or alien influences. Would it not be better to
withhold a necessary paper, than to give it
wrongfully? Would it not be better to incur
Farnsworth&rsquo;s displeasure for not having done
his bidding, than to do it if it were not really
his? And then she remembered Helen&rsquo;s frantic
message. Surely that meant something!
Surely it could mean nothing but that the packet
must be kept from possible predatory hands!</p>
<p>She determined, rightly or wrongly, she would
not believe Farnsworth had sent this man unless
she had some more indubitable proof.</p>
<p>She knew that an alien spy in our country&rsquo;s
uniform was not an impossibility, and she
feared to accept this man&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I must repeat
that I have no such packet as you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The untruth of this did not disturb Patty&rsquo;s
conscience, for she knew that aside from the
accepted law that all&rsquo;s fair in love and war,&mdash;military
secrets must be kept inviolate even at
the sacrifice of truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the visitor returned, &ldquo;that I
must disbelieve that. Moreover, I regret to
add, I must do my best to find the packet. Captain
Farnsworth warned me that you might
prove thus obdurate, and that in that case, I
must seek the papers for myself. He even went
so far as to tell me that they were in the old
Winthrop desk. <i>Now</i> do you believe in my
integrity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only the triumphant glance of the man&rsquo;s
eye that kept Patty from believing him. She
reasoned that if he were an honest messenger
he would be earnestly anxious but not victoriously
glad.</p>
<p>His air of having conquered gave an immediate
impression of expected opposition and she
was on her guard.</p>
<p>If Farnsworth had really told him the papers
were in that old desk he would, she felt sure,
have confided it to her, and not have announced
it with an air of braggadocio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of your integrity,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;but a matter of fact. The papers
are not in this old desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colton strode forward and threw the desk
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the secret drawers?&rdquo; he asked,
abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; and Patty showed him the small
hidden springs that opened the concealed spaces
so often found in old desks.</p>
<p>With meticulous care, Colton went all over the
desk, measuring and calculating, in his endeavour
to find the papers. But he at last
turned a baffled face to Patty.</p>
<p>She looked pleasantly interested, but said
simply, &ldquo;You are mistaken, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the desk, yes, but I must find the
papers. Sorry, Miss Fairfield, but my duty
must be done. I believe what I seek is in this
room, and I must make search for it. With
your permission&mdash;or without&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go ahead,&rdquo; Patty laughed, for she
deemed it wiser to make no objection, &ldquo;search
all you like. May I stay here, or would you
rather be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, please,&rdquo; and a shrewd glance was
thrown toward her.</p>
<p>An indicative glance it was, too,&mdash;though it
was not meant to be. But Patty&rsquo;s quick wits
told her that he wished her to remain, hoping
she would by some involuntary glance, disclose
the hiding-place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>This gave her new courage, and she determined
to look anywhere save toward the old
album that held the papers. If he should find
them, she would defend them with her life, if
need be, she thought. But if they were not
discovered the victory was hers. She was convinced
now that this was no emissary of Farnsworth&rsquo;s.
Had he been, he would have gone
back for further instructions, before he made
such desperate search.</p>
<p>Moreover, his attitude would have been confidential
and persuasive,&mdash;not belligerent and
domineering.</p>
<p>So she watched him, a little amused smile on
her face, that gave no hint of her perturbation
of spirit.</p>
<p>She carefully let her eyes follow the directions
taken by his own, but never by any chance led
him to a fresh field of search.</p>
<p>Frequently he looked up quickly, hoping to
catch her gaze straying to the real hiding-place,
but Patty was too canny for that.</p>
<p>Once or twice she allowed him to intercept a
furtive glance, carefully turned in the wrong
direction, and her look of embarrassment led
him to turn his attention that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>But all to no purpose. He looked everywhere,
as he supposed, where the packet could
have been hidden. He even moved the books
on the side table, taking up the album itself, and
laying it down again, assuming that the thick
packet could not be between the leaves of any
book.</p>
<p>And now came Patty&rsquo;s supreme test of nerve
and poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think you&rsquo;re very smart,&rdquo; he
said, irritatedly, &ldquo;to have hidden the thing so
securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so, if that exhaustive search of
yours failed to find it,&rdquo; she replied, but not
triumphantly at all. &ldquo;However, you must remember
that I assured you I hadn&rsquo;t the papers.
You cannot, therefore, expect me to be surprised
that you didn&rsquo;t unearth them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I salute you, Miss Fairfield, as an exceedingly
clever young woman in more ways than
one. I cannot tarry longer,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid you&rsquo;ll be caught here?&rdquo; Patty
couldn&rsquo;t resist this fling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I must report to Captain Farnsworth.
He will send some one else, doubtless, who may
succeed where I have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; said Patty, drily.</p>

<p>Patty at the piano, sang out the stirring words
of the refrain and then began on the second
verse:</p>

<p class="t">For the Flag and the Girl back home!</p>
</div>
<p>Patty wound up with a grand flourish of voice
and piano keys, just as Helen came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is it all right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&mdash;I hope so,&mdash;but what did
happen, Bumble? Who is Sergeant Colton,
and what do you mean by your telephone
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half hysterical, Helen told the whole story of
her experiences of the night before. She confessed
fully and frankly that she had babbled
unthinkingly, and that Mrs. Lummis had made
use of her revelations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody come here?&rdquo; she asked,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say yes!&rdquo; Patty returned, but
Helen&rsquo;s fear and misery were so poignant,
Patty&rsquo;s kind heart wouldn&rsquo;t let her scold the
culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved the day by telephoning, Bumble,
if you hadn&rsquo;t, there would have been very grave
trouble. Now, don&rsquo;t think any more about it;
but I&rsquo;m not going to let you know things after
this. You were terribly thoughtless, but I know
you must have suffered from remorse and regret,
so let&rsquo;s not talk any more about it. The
papers are safe, so far. I&rsquo;m sorry it is known
that I have them,&mdash;but even that isn&rsquo;t positively
known. Your Mrs. Lummis is a spy, or, at
least, conniving with spies. It was strange you
should drift into her house in that way, but
spies are everywhere now. Run upstairs, dear,
and get your things off, and get calmed down.
Don&rsquo;t worry over what you&rsquo;ve done, and&mdash;listen,
Helen, don&rsquo;t tell anybody, not even Nan,
about it. You <i>must</i> learn to keep your mouth
shut. Now, I forgive you, and I&rsquo;ll forget what
has happened, if you&rsquo;ll promise never to talk to
any one, not even to me, about secret service
matters or papers or anything pertaining to
Captain Farnsworth&rsquo;s or my connection with
affairs of state.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will promise, Patty, and you&rsquo;re awful good
to me. I was careless and thoughtless, but that
woman was so kind and wheedlesome, she got
it out of me before I knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see just how it was. You don&rsquo;t appreciate
or realise the deep responsibility of these
secret matters. I do, and so, remember, even
you and I must never mention them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen went off to her room, and Patty turned
back to the piano.</p>
<p>It was a habit of hers to sing when perturbed
or anxious, and this new song was a favourite
with her, and she sang it with a clear, vibrant
energy that made the house ring with melody.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Colours flying for Victory,</p>
<p class="t">For the Flag and the Girl back home!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great little old song!&rdquo; said a voice
behind her, and Patty looked up to see Phil Van
Reypen coming into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it? I like it best of all the new
war songs. There&rsquo;s a fine swing to the music,
and a stunning accompaniment. When did you
come up from the South? At break of
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about. And I&rsquo;m here only for a few
minutes, but I have a warning for you. Be very
careful, Patty,&rdquo; Phil drew nearer and lowered
his voice, &ldquo;of anything Farnsworth may trust
to you. You remember Herron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a spy, or rather, a tool of a spy. In
our uniform, among our soldiers, he has been
suspected of selling our secrets. That whole
performance at the Country Club was a cooked-up
job. Munson was the plotter, and he was
trying to get from your pocket the letter that
he hoped was another and a more important
paper. Since then, they have worked silently
toward the same end. Beware of Herron,
Patty, but don&rsquo;t let him know you suspect him.
It is only suspicion so far, nothing has been
proved, but he is under strict surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s heart beat fast, &ldquo;I would
defend Bill&rsquo;s confidential matters with my very
life. Something has happened,&mdash;but I feel it&rsquo;s
better not to tell you the details. Tell me this,
though. Supposing some one came to me, purporting
to be sent by Captain Farnsworth and
using as a token of faith a word dear and
familiar to Bill and myself. Could that have
been learned by an outsider and used, or, would
you think it really meant a message from
Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distrust it, Patty. These people have almost
incredible powers of getting hold of just such
arguments or persuasions. Distrust always,&mdash;is
the best rule toward any stranger. Farnsworth,
if he sends you a message at all, by a
man who is a stranger to you, will make it so
that you can have no possible doubt of its
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty drew a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Just what I
thought,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m frightened,
Philip. I feel so weak, so inexperienced, to
defend these secrets. It is a terrible responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Patty, of course. But, look at it this
way. Whatever Farnsworth asks of you, he
feels you are capable of accomplishing. So,
make good,&mdash;justify his faith in you, by bravely
accepting the responsibility, and succeeding in
the task.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can do anything when I feel I&rsquo;m helping
him,&rdquo; said Patty, softly. &ldquo;Anything to help
him along, with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Colours flying for Victory,</p>
<p class="t">For the Flag and the Girl back home!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Reypen&rsquo;s heart contracted as he looked
at Patty&rsquo;s lovely face, aglow with love and
patriotism. He was slowly but very surely
coming round to the opinion that he could never
win her heart away from Farnsworth. He
had hoped to do this, not in any dishonourable
way, but only in confidence of his own devotion,
and a hope that Patty&rsquo;s affection for
Farnsworth was but a temporary infatuation.</p>
<p>But it was becoming more and more clear to
him, that Patty&rsquo;s heart was given once and for
all time to his rival, and though deeply disappointed,
Phil was man enough not to whine.</p>
<p>Besides, his motto was, &ldquo;the game&rsquo;s never out
till it&rsquo;s played out,&rdquo; and he had not yet abandoned
all hope. Also, he was absolutely fair,
and never by word or implication said anything
to Farnsworth&rsquo;s disparagement or obtruded
himself unduly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I sing every time I go up in my
airplane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For the Flag and the
Girl back home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your Flag,&mdash;but who&rsquo;s your girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy!&rdquo; Patty laughed in her gay, sweet
fashion. Secure in her single-hearted devotion
to Bill, she felt no fear of Philip, and treated
him with a serene un-self-consciousness, that
went far to convince him of the hopelessness of
his suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you&rsquo;re my girl, even if you aren&rsquo;t
My Girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean even if I&rsquo;m not your only girl.
Would you be surprised, Philip, my child, to
learn that I know more about Your Girl than
you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you know more about yourself
than I can possibly know about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that isn&rsquo;t what I mean a little bit! But
I won&rsquo;t tell you now, only some time, I will
tell you the meaning of my cryptic utterance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to be informed, at your convenience,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>And then Helen came into the room, and leaving
her to entertain Van Reypen, Patty ran
away to look after some of her own affairs.</p>
<p>It was that same afternoon that Lieutenant
Herron called.</p>
<p>Patty was inclined to refuse to see him, and
then thought better of that, for, she argued to
herself, perhaps she could learn something
from him.</p>
<p>She went down to greet him, with a pleasant
smile and a courteous manner.</p>
<p>To her surprise, she found him in a perturbed
and nervous state, fidgeting about the room as
he awaited her appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she invited, but he
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here only for a minute, I had to come.
Patty,&rdquo; he grasped her two hands in his own,
and glanced wildly about, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frantic because
of love for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Herron!&rdquo; Patty cried, startled
by his strange demeanour and trying to release
her hands from his burning grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t repulse me! Patty, you little
darling, I&rsquo;m crazy I know,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t help
it! I&rsquo;ve loved you from the first minute I laid
eyes on you! That my case is hopeless, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t believe! Oh, have pity on me,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>The man quite broke down, and raising Patty&rsquo;s
hands to his lips he covered them with burning
kisses.</p>
<p>Patty was not frightened. Often in her life
she had experienced the sensation of a sudden
and unexpected outbreak such as this, and she
was entirely mistress of the situation.</p>
<p>But she was conscious of a strong desire to
ask this suspected man a few leading questions
as to certain matters, yet it seemed a mean thing,
to take advantage of his protestations of affection
for her.</p>
<p>But, she reflected, all&rsquo;s fair in love and war,
and if she could find out something that her
Little Billee wanted to know, it surely could
not be wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Lieutenant Herron,&rdquo; she said, at last
drawing away her hands; &ldquo;I know I have only
to remind you that you are talking to the
affianced wife of another man to make you
realise what you are doing. As a soldier and
a gentleman you will not, I am sure, continue
such avowals. Please, don&rsquo;t, and I will promise
to forget what you have just said. Did you
come on an errand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this. My only errand is to tell you
of my love and beg for a ray of hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>It was not going to be so easy, after all,
Patty discovered, but she said, gently, &ldquo;There
is no ray of hope for you, Mr. Herron, and I
am sure it is the kindest thing to tell you so at
once. I am appreciative of your regard, but
I am also exceedingly surprised. I cannot feel
that I have given you any encouragement or
any reason to think I have an especial interest
in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t given me what could be
called encouragement, I know, and I suppose
I ought to have known better than to fall over
head and ears in love with your exquisite face
and winning personality. But we cannot rule
our hearts always, and the moment I saw you I
knew it was all up with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frank, boyish face was pathetic in its utter
woe, and Patty felt truly sorry for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;the best thing
to do is to drop this subject right here and now.
Indeed I must insist on your doing so if I continue
to talk to you. Where are you stationed
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;I&rsquo;m on the jump. I say,
Miss Fairfield, I&rsquo;m all broken up. I guess I&rsquo;ll
go away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Herron. Make up your
mind to forget this little episode and I will do
the same. By the way, do you think you played
quite fair the day we were at the Country
Club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. No, I don&rsquo;t. But I was so
anxious to be with you, that I took any opportunity
that offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, you didn&rsquo;t have to lend yourself to&mdash;to
underhanded proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herron, Patty saw, was on his guard at once.
But so was she. No word, she determined,
should be spoken by her that might be misused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; she
parried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we neither of us know, and that&rsquo;s best
after all,&rdquo; he returned, gravely. &ldquo;Now, Miss
Fairfield, I&rsquo;m going&mdash;out of your life forever.
I&rsquo;ve told you my sorry story,&mdash;but I hope I&rsquo;m
man enough to accept your dismissal properly.
No matter what I&rsquo;ve been or done, I&rsquo;m going
to do something for you now. At least, for the
man you love,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s for you,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathed Patty, wondering what was
coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just this. When you see Captain
Farnsworth,&mdash;don&rsquo;t on any account trust this to
writing,&mdash;when you see him, alone, tell him to
watch out for a certain wire-puller in Washington.
Tell him that he&rsquo;s trying to sidetrack
him into the Searchlight gang,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak his name. But tell Captain
Farnsworth that it begins with S and ends with
s. He&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is straight goods, I&rsquo;m much obliged
to you, Mr. Herron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. It&rsquo;s gospel truth, and Farnsworth
will be glad to know it. Moreover, he&rsquo;ll be
greatly surprised. But it will be to him valuable
information. When shall you see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I doubt if it is soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you telephone&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t do that. Do
you have a cipher code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t. But wouldn&rsquo;t a sealed and
registered letter do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s unsafe. Try to see him as soon as
you can. Now I must go. I suppose I mayn&rsquo;t
ask you for anything for a&mdash;a keepsake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s gentle heart was touched by the sadness
in the poor chap&rsquo;s face, and she looked
about. On the table lay a little book of verses
that she was fond of and had often read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; she said, kindly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so tiny
you can put it in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gratefully he accepted the souvenir, and as
he bowed himself out, Patty couldn&rsquo;t help admiring
his big manly figure and his military
bearing.</p>
<p>She wandered to the piano, and absent-mindedly
ran over the chorus of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Colours flying for Victory,</p>
<p class="t">For the Flag and the Girl back home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The ringing of the telephone bell brought her
to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a well-loved voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Your
Own. I&rsquo;ll be with you in about twenty minutes.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty to
herself. &ldquo;What a sudden one he is, to be
sure! He fairly takes my breath away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to spread the good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Billee&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; she cried to Nan
and Helen, who were in the sitting-room, waiting
to hear the account of Lieutenant Herron&rsquo;s
call. But this new information quite eclipsed
their interest in Herron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried Nan. &ldquo;When? How long
will he stay?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Didn&rsquo;t get any details, only he&rsquo;ll
be here in twenty minutes and thank goodness,
that other person has departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herron? What&rsquo;d he come for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On an errand,&rdquo; and Patty smiled to think
of the ridiculous boy daring to make love to
her. &ldquo;He had a bee in his bonnet,&mdash;a most
foolish bee, and I had to get it out for him.
Oh, my Little Billee&rsquo;s coming! I&rsquo;m so
glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She danced about the room, scarce able to control
her impatience for the necessary twenty
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I wait?&rdquo; she frowned, &ldquo;seems&rsquo;s
if I&rsquo;d just perfectly fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and sing that favourite song of yours,&rdquo;
advised Nan. &ldquo;That always keeps you contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like it, but I&rsquo;m too happy to sing. I
want to dance or fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty executed some most intricate and marvellous
dancing steps and like a fairy girl indeed,
she looked, as with waving arms and
graceful gestures, she pirouetted round the
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter of the Regiment,&rdquo; she announced,
as she fell into martial step and to the accompaniment
of the Soldier Boy song, she marched
down stairs.</p>
<p>Helen followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy, Bumble, my pet,&rdquo; Patty said; &ldquo;sorry,
but I&rsquo;ve just got to see my own Little Billee
all alone. So, you&rsquo;ll forgive me if I drop a
gentle hint that you&rsquo;re not invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Patsy; but listen a minute. I
just want to say this. If you think better to tell
Bill about what I did, you tell him. I&rsquo;d hate
to have him know it, I admit, but if it&rsquo;s right,
why, tell him, and I&rsquo;ll take the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a goody girl, Bumble, dear, but I
don&rsquo;t believe it will be necessary. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll
know that I have your permission to tell and
I&rsquo;ll see if I think it&rsquo;s best to do so. Probably
I&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s better not to tell him, for no
real harm was done, you know,&mdash;and yet,
it may be that I&rsquo;ll think he ought to know
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Lieutenant Herron want, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I say. He actually had the nerve to
tell me he admired me. I thought of sending
for you and offering you as a substitute. But
truly, Bumble, honey, he isn&rsquo;t a reliable citizen.
He&rsquo;s&mdash;well, we won&rsquo;t say it out loud,&mdash;but he
isn&rsquo;t our sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. I know a lot about him. But
did he really dare lift his eyes to you, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really did. You see a soldier is of
necessity a brave man, and it seems Lieutenant
Herron is one of the bravest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave! He&rsquo;s a blind bat, if he thinks you&rsquo;d
look at him twice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or once even. You see my heart and hands
are full with the one man in the world for me,
and Mr. Herron&rsquo;s sentiments are not even
interesting to me. And now, my dearest
cousin, if you&rsquo;ll take your departure, I&rsquo;ll compose
myself to await my visitor. Sit still, my
fluttering heart!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />PATTY AND BILL</h2>
<p>Watching from the window, Patty
saw him coming and in a moment the
big man had gathered the dainty little
figure into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blossom Girl,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;my own
Patty Precious, are you glad to be <i>here</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I just am!&rdquo; and Patty drew back to
look in his eyes, and then flung her arms round
his neck in a burst of joyous gladness. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;re so high up, Little Billee,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going up!&rdquo; said Bill, and he swung her
from the floor up into his close embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, after a series of kisses,
&ldquo;now, will you be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty, laughing and breathless, was deposited
on the sofa, and Bill sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed angel,&rdquo; he said, looking at her
as if he could never look his fill, &ldquo;I wish I
could just talk love nonsense to you, instead
of telling you what I must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very bad, dear?&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s smile
faded at the serious look in her lover&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad, Patty-Pet, but a soldier&rsquo;s life is
not a lazy one. To put it as briefly as possible,
I&rsquo;m ordered to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill-lee! Me, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid not, Sweetheart, it&rsquo;s a special mission
and a hurry call, and all sorts of disagreeable
stipulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my country&rsquo;s good, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, it would take too long to explain,
and you couldn&rsquo;t altogether understand it, anyway,
but in a few words, it&rsquo;s to look after some
mining operations. You see, my plans for investigating
a certain coal mine district in France
have been approved by the Powers That Be.
It seems that there has been a ghastly destruction
of the mines by the enemy and the coal
supply for the railroads is imperilled and all
sorts of troubles are toward. So re-construction
is necessary, if they are to get coal for
the Allies&rsquo; use in the Northeast part of Fair
France. My experience in re-building wrecked
mines in Colorado counts for a lot, and so I&rsquo;m
picked for duty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wonderful man!&rdquo; and Patty&rsquo;s eyes
gleamed with admiration as she looked at the
eager, fine face, full of efficiency and enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Oh, and Billee, dear, that reminds me,
Lieutenant Herron said to tell you to watch out
for a certain wire-puller in Washington&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Patty, can we be overheard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ll close this door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll close it, but remember, dear, you must
never tell secrets where any servant or any one
at all can by chance learn of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Well, Mr. Herron said to watch
out for this person, for he is trying to sidetrack
you into the Searchlight gang,&mdash;whatever
that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herron said this? Did he tell you the
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it began with S and ended with s,
and that you&rsquo;d know from that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Did Herron say that! Why,
Patty,&mdash;are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure; and he said you&rsquo;d be surprised but
you&rsquo;d be glad of the information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so! Why, Patty, you&rsquo;ve no
idea of the enormous importance of that warning!
Him! Well, well!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to help you, Billee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Herron happen to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty hesitated. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, blushingly,
&ldquo;Lieutenant Herron did me the honour
to make love to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what do you mean by &lsquo;make love&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing! Please don&rsquo;t bite my head off! I
only mean he seemed to admire me,&mdash;or said he
did,&mdash;and I sent him flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so! The scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, Little Billee, he may be a
scoundrel,&mdash;I&rsquo;m told he is one,&mdash;but not because
he admired me! A cat may look at a
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no cat or king or scrubby little lieutenant
may look at my Patty Blossom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he didn&rsquo;t! The Miss Fairfield he
looked at is a very different personage from
your Patty Blossom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Patty sprang up, &ldquo;this is the
lady he saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood, with a most dignified air, and a
coldly courteous expression, looking a little
bored, and exceedingly formal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Then she broke into a happy smile, and holding
out her arms in a lovely gesture of welcome
came toward Farnsworth, her blue eyes beaming
with love and happiness, saying, &ldquo;and <i>this</i>
is your Patty Blossom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth jumped for her in an ecstasy of
gladness, and Herron&rsquo;s presumptuous intrusion
was forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just when do you go to France?&rdquo; asked
Patty, after a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. I&rsquo;m awaiting orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll stay here till you go?&rdquo; She
nestled comfortably in his arms, and smiled up
into his loving face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, my lady fair. I&rsquo;m even now on
my way to Springfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Springfield! Whatever for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making some tests for the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tests of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey-girl, you can&rsquo;t understand,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
a test of the water- or moisture-resisting qualities
of certain explosives used in the setting off
of blasts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee, you&rsquo;ll be blown up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t the people who make the explosives
do their own testing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it has to be a Government test,&mdash;to
decide between various competitors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, in so far as they entrust these
things to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee,&mdash;Captain, my Captain,
I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> proud of you! I do believe you&rsquo;re the
biggest man in the Service,&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean
physically, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that, Blossom, but I do have responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they wear on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do, indeed! So, for just a few moments
I&rsquo;m going to forget them utterly, and
only remember the touch of your pink blossom
fingers and the sweetness of your flower-face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Big Little Billee! For such a strong
person you are very gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you how could I be otherwise? Now,
Pattibelle, what about it? Can you make our
wedding-day an earlier date, and go along
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said I couldn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, if you&rsquo;ll marry me in time. But I
just &rsquo;most know you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t, dear. Why, you may go
any day, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;can&rsquo;t,&mdash;won&rsquo;t you go, too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>The wistfulness in the earnest face touched
Patty&rsquo;s heart, but she couldn&rsquo;t quite say yes to
this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you expect to be over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. It may be for years and it
may be forever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that literally&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be at the front?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; unless some emergency calls for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Patty sighed, &ldquo;I see I&rsquo;ll have to
be sensible for us both. In the first place, dear,
you&rsquo;d be hampered with a bride&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hampered! Oh, Patty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;but your work would. I
see it more clearly than you do. All you think
of is to get me to go with you. But you don&rsquo;t
realise how it would bother you to have me
along. Why, I doubt if you&rsquo;d be allowed to
take me, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Farnsworth
frowned. &ldquo;But, then, how can I leave you?
Oh, my little Posy Face, you don&rsquo;t know yet
what you mean to me! And,&mdash;after I&rsquo;m gone,&mdash;you&rsquo;d&mdash;Patty!
you&rsquo;d flirt,&mdash;you know you
would!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! <i>no!</i>&rdquo; and the big blue eyes were
full of mock horror. &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;d take the
veil and do nothing but weep until you came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little rascal,&mdash;how you do love to tease
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, Patty did. Whole-hearted,
single-hearted, her love was all Farnsworth&rsquo;s&mdash;once
and forever, but her gay nature
made her love to play on his big, honest sensitive
heart as on a lute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said, calmly, as she twined her
little pink fingers into his big, strong ones,
&ldquo;because you take teasing so beautifully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scallywag! I think I&rsquo;ll just grab you up
and carry you off,&mdash;willy-nilly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did know what willy-nilly means, and
I&rsquo;d love to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out when you&rsquo;re my wife! I expect
you to obey my lightest word! I shall be
a regular caveman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re big enough, but you&rsquo;ve got about as
much of the &lsquo;caveman&rsquo; temperament as a
kitten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farnsworth laughed, well knowing that the
soft, gentle personality of the girl he loved
would never be cowed or coerced by his will.
He knew he could persuade her through love,
where harsher means would be useless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>Big Bill Farnsworth perfectly understood
Patty&rsquo;s nature, and her little inconsistencies and
whimsicalities bothered him not a whit.</p>
<p>He was most desirous to take her to France
with him, but he knew too, that her commonsense
view of that matter was the right one.
He knew that, even were he allowed to take
a wife with him, there would be many rude
experiences, even dangers, which Patty must
face, and yet he shrank from the thought of
leaving her for an indefinite, perhaps for a
very long time.</p>
<p>Farnsworth went on to Springfield with the
question still unsettled.</p>
<p>At least, to his satisfaction, Patty declared
that it was settled. She bravely accepted the
fact of his necessary absence because it was his
duty to his country, and Patty was patriotic
first, last and all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>care</i>?&rdquo; asked Helen, curiously;
&ldquo;what are you made of, Patty, that you can
let him go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it does look strange to you,
Bumble,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t understand,
dear. I know Billee would do better work and
get along with less care and anxiety without me
than with me. I know I should be a hindrance
and I <i>daren&rsquo;t</i> go. I mustn&rsquo;t put a straw in the
way of his splendid career,&mdash;I mustn&rsquo;t be the
least mite of a millstone about his neck. It is
because my love for him is so complete, so all-enveloping,&mdash;that
I know I <i>must</i> sacrifice myself
to it&mdash;and to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Patty, he&rsquo;ll think you don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Helen. And that I have to
bear, too. If he knew how I want to go,&mdash;how
I long to go,&mdash;how it seems as if I <i>must</i>
go,&mdash;he never would go off without me! I
have to bid him good-bye, smilingly,&mdash;even
though my heart breaks after he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Patty, I did misjudge you.
You are bigger than I am. I should be too
selfish to look at it as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect love casts out selfishness, Helen,
even as it casts out fear. I know I am right.
I&rsquo;ve thought it all out for myself. It is my
duty to stay at home, and to send my Billee
away, with only words of cheer and Godspeed.
It is my duty not to let him know my real feelings,&mdash;I
mean the depth of sorrow and grief
that I feel at his going. It is my duty to make
it as easy for him to go as I possibly can,&mdash;and
that can only be done by a light, even seemingly
careless attitude on my part. I know what I&rsquo;m
talking about, dear, and I know that if he knew
what is really in my heart for him,&mdash;he would
take me with him&mdash;or,&mdash;stay at home! Oh, I
don&rsquo;t dare, Bumble, I don&rsquo;t <i>dare</i> let him
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s earnestness carried conviction, and
Helen saw at last that Patty&rsquo;s sacrifice was
because of the greatness of her love, not the
lack of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is between you and me, Helen.
You are to tell no one, not even Nan, that I
feel more deeply than I show. If Billee learns
of my&mdash;oh, Helen,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Patty burst into
agonised tears, &ldquo;if he should know,&mdash;and
should coax me to go,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t refuse
him! I&rsquo;d give in,&mdash;and I mustn&rsquo;t, Bumble, I
<i>mustn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little hands clenched and the white teeth
fairly gritted in the desperation of Patty&rsquo;s
resolve.</p>
<p>And Helen at last understood that there is a
love that is above consideration of self, and
sacrifices personal happiness for the welfare of
the loved one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>The date of Farnsworth&rsquo;s trip to France was
imminent, yet uncertain, and when Patty received
an unexpected invitation from a school
friend to make a little visit in Washington, she
accepted gladly. It would give her a chance to
be near Little Billee, and her friend, Rose Barrett,
would, she knew, be most kind and sympathetic.</p>
<p>Helen was to go with Patty as far as Wilmington,
where she, too, was to visit a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take you to your friend&rsquo;s very
house!&rdquo; Patty declared, &ldquo;or else you&rsquo;ll bring
up in some alien household again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; returned Bumble, &ldquo;I can find
the place by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Patty insisted, and when the two girls
reached Wilmington, they went together to the
house where Helen was to stay.</p>
<p>Philip Van Reypen was there to greet them,
for he was a friend of Bumble&rsquo;s hostess, and
knew of the girls&rsquo; coming.</p>
<p>And then, nothing would do, but that Patty
must stay there over night and go to the Aviation
Field next morning to see the stunts there.</p>
<p>Quite willing, Patty agreed, and telephoned to
Rose Barrett not to expect her till the following
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>The trip to the Aviation Field was full of
novelty and pleasure. Fascinated, Patty
watched the great machines as they swept
and swerved and was interested in all the
details and wonders of the whole place.</p>
<p>A gay young Lieutenant by the name of Breen
was introduced and Patty found him a most
pleasant and intelligent guide. With him she
went about, seeing things, while Van Reypen
escorted Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go for a little fly, Miss
Fairfield?&rdquo; asked Breen, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; said Patty, her eyes sparkling
at the thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy to, but I can&rsquo;t,
thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised not to,&mdash;promised somebody to
whom I always keep my promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a man, though I usually keep my promises
to women, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad promise is better broken than kept,&rdquo;
Breen said, laughingly; &ldquo;come on in,&mdash;the air&rsquo;s
fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, fie, Lieutenant, to tempt me to break
my promises! I&rsquo;m ashamed of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d like to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t promised&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, I won&rsquo;t tempt you. I know
just how you feel. We all have to keep promises
sometimes that we wish we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jolly young man continued to keep her
interested in the sights and at last he said,
&ldquo;Suppose you just get in here, and see how it
seems, I don&rsquo;t mean to fly, you know, but just
have the experience of getting in and out
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty consented to this, and took her seat as
directed.</p>
<p>Just how it all came about, she never quite
knew, but soon she found herself gently rising
from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, let me
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; said Breen, his eyes on his
machinery; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak to me. Yes, we&rsquo;re
going for a tiny spin, and you can have it out
with me afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty was aghast, but she realised with her
quick common-sense that she must not speak to
Breen, or distract his attention in any way.</p>
<p>But she said quietly, &ldquo;Please put me out as
soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light laugh was his reply, and they soared
higher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>Finding herself utterly unable to prevent the
trip, and knowing not at all how long it would
last or where it would terminate, Patty, with
her usual adjustment to circumstances, allowed
herself to enjoy it. The day was perfect, the
air cold and clear, and the sensation of the
strange motion wonderfully exhilarating.</p>
<p>After a short time her tense muscles relaxed
a bit, and she breathed more freely. She
didn&rsquo;t feel afraid, but felt a strong nervous tension,
and an intense desire to get down again.
She tried to speak to Breen, in spite of his
warning, but the noise of the motor drowned
her voice.</p>
<p>She looked about, or tried to, when suddenly
she became aware that a strand of her hair
had loosened and was caught in something.</p>
<p>Terribly frightened, and feeling sure that to
move her head would precipitate some awful
disaster, Patty put her wits to work.</p>
<p>Her hair was caught in a piston at the side
of the machine, and any gentle movement failed
to loosen it. A stronger jerk would tear her
hair out by the roots, and Patty wondered if
this were not what she ought to do to avert
worse disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>She bethought herself of a tiny pair of scissors
in her little handbag and wondered if she could
get them. It was a difficult process, but she
managed it at last, only by getting them with
one hand and being obliged to drop the bag
overboard in the process. It contained money
and some small valuables, but all Patty thought
of now, was to release her head from that ever
increasing pull.</p>
<p>Cautiously she raised her hand, calculating the
direction with difficulty.</p>
<p>But she managed to accomplish her aim, and
with several short steady clips she severed the
strand of hair and liberated her strained
head.</p>
<p>Quite unconsciously she clung to the scissors,
and though she realised the great danger was
over, she felt faint with the reaction.</p>
<p>After what seemed an interminable time, they
reached the ground again, having really made
a very short flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Miss Fairfield,&rdquo; said Lieutenant
Breen, gaily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had a fly, and yet you&rsquo;ve
kept your promise! For you certainly did not
go of your own volition! Why,&mdash;what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty looked at him with such reproach and
scorn that the boy,&mdash;for he was little more,&mdash;was
overcome with dismay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could you?&rdquo; she stormed, &ldquo;have you
any idea how offended I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said, dumfoundedly;
&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Patty realised that he thought she
was a giddy girl who would love the lark as he
planned it, and who was only kept from giving
consent by a foolish promise. He had no idea
her promise was to her a sacred rite, and to
break it was her horror. Moreover, he knew
nothing of the danger she had been through.
When she showed him her clipped lock of hair,
he was even more distressed than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry! Can you <i>ever</i> forgive
me! What pluck! Miss Fairfield, you are a
heroine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed Patty was. She was praised and
exploited and complimented on her bravery and
cleverness until she was positively embarrassed.</p>
<p>And the Lieutenant told her that if Captain
Farnsworth had any punishment in store for
him, he would submit to it without a murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he grinned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something to tell of
all my life! Cut off her hair on the fly! Gee
whiz!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />PATTY&rsquo;S WEDDING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And I went up in an aeroplane,&rdquo; Patty
said, looking squarely into Bill&rsquo;s blue
eyes.</p>
<p>They stood in the pretty little drawing-room
at Rose Barrett&rsquo;s. Farnsworth had just come,
hastening to see Patty, on her arrival in Washington.</p>
<p>He held Patty&rsquo;s two hands in his own, and
after a deep gaze into the troubled eyes lifted
to his, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who tricked you into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee, how <i>did</i> you know that
was the way it happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it couldn&rsquo;t happen any other way.
You promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t, and so you
must have been coerced or tricked into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was!&rdquo; and Patty described the
whole performance.</p>
<p>Farnsworth shuddered as she told of her hair
getting caught in the piston, and drew her
closely to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling,&mdash;my blessed little girl, how
<i>can</i> I go off and leave you? In these times
nobody is safe from dangers! But you&rsquo;ll <i>never</i>
even run such a chance again, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve had my lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a severe one. Why, the shock might
have made you ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, nearly. But I had to stay on deck
till I could see you, and tell you about it. And
then, I didn&rsquo;t have to tell you! You knew yourself!
How did you understand so perfectly
and so quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty, you and I are&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t think of
the perfect English word. The French would
say <i>en rapport</i>, the Italians would say <i>simpatica</i>.
But we are&mdash;at one, is perhaps the
best phrase. We shall always be so. It&rsquo;s
utter trust, you know, and absolute faith in each
other. Isn&rsquo;t it, my girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; and Patty laid her hand caressingly
on the khaki-clad shoulder of the big man,
as she gave him a smile of perfect confidence.
&ldquo;Oh, my Little Billee, I don&rsquo;t want you to go
away from me. I&rsquo;ve just begun to realise what
losing you will mean to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be for long, dearest.
Things look a little as if I may make only a
short trip, and return soon with my reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said a voice loudly and repeatedly
outside the half-closed door. &ldquo;May I come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Rose,&rdquo; laughed Patty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
share my last interview with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Farnsworth isn&rsquo;t going right
off, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not today,&rdquo; returned Bill. &ldquo;But of
course, there&rsquo;s no telling how soon it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you tonight for a little party,&rdquo; Rose
went on. &ldquo;I find I can get Lieutenant Van
Reypen and Helen Barlow over and I&rsquo;m asking
a few more. I think in these days of unrest
we must have a bit of relaxation when we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said Farnsworth, heartily;
&ldquo;I can come, I&rsquo;m sure, unless something sudden
and unexpected turns up. Count on me, Mrs.
Barrett. But I must run away now, for I&rsquo;ve
an immediate appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a darling!&rdquo; Rose exclaimed, as she
and Patty watched the military figure stride
down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is! Sometimes I fear I&rsquo;m not grateful
enough for the love and devotion of such a
wonderful man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;Naughty girl! &lsquo;Down on your knees, and
thank Heaven, fasting, for a good man&rsquo;s love,&rsquo;
as Friend Shakespeare puts it. Now, run away
and get a beauty-nap, so you&rsquo;ll be chipper tonight.
I&rsquo;m going to have quite a party, I can
tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Barrett&rsquo;s husband was in a position to
be informed regarding certain matters, and
Rose knew, though Patty didn&rsquo;t, that in all
probability Farnsworth would sail the next day
for France.</p>
<p>And by way of farewell and also, by way
of introducing Patty to some friends, Rose
planned rather an elaborate reception.</p>
<p>Helen Barlow came before dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patsy!&rdquo; she cried, in ecstasy, &ldquo;I am
having the grandest time! War is awful, of
course, but somehow everybody who isn&rsquo;t fighting,
is so kind, and we&rsquo;ve had wonderful experiences.
I&rsquo;ve been flying twice and I didn&rsquo;t have
to cut off my raving tresses, either! What <i>did</i>
Bill say to scold you for going up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t break off our engagement,&rdquo;
Patty returned, smiling. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Phil? Is
he coming over, tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is,&mdash;he goes wherever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Helen stopped, blushing crimson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goes wherever you do? Of course he does!
How you do lead him on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either! He has eyes only for you,
Patty Fairfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used to have, you mean. But that was before
my enchanting cousin came on the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish! Philip&rsquo;s crazy about you, still.
Your being engaged to Little Billee doesn&rsquo;t prevent
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means nothing to me,&rdquo; declared Patty;
&ldquo;my sweetheart hath my heart and I have his,
so, Phil may come and Phil may go, but we go
on forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re poetic today! I hear Bill sails
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. That&rsquo;s as may be. Oh, Bumble,
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears, and Helen regretted
her chance allusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Pattikins, you must remember
what it means to be a soldier&rsquo;s sweetheart, and
bid him good-bye, with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Colours flying for Victory,</p>
<p class="t">For the Flag and the Girl back home!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well for you,&mdash;you&rsquo;re
not the Girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, he&rsquo;ll return with colours still flying,
to the Girl back home, and then it will be
June and the wedding bells will ring, and the
birds will sing and the orange bloomers bloom
and the khaki on the groom and the veil on
Patty-Pat, and I&rsquo;ll wear a posy hat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, hush!&rdquo; cried Patty laughing at
the foolish chatter as Bumble danced about the
room, waving her arms as she sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, truly, Patsy, you won&rsquo;t have more&rsquo;n
time to get your gewgaws fixed up and your
monogramming done, before Bill will be back
again, and it will be June. Oh, soon! It
will be June! and to this tune,&mdash;Tum, tum,
te-tum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen sang the first strains of the wedding
march, and Patty ran out of the room laughing,
as Rose called her to the telephone.</p>
<p>It was Farnsworth speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angel child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you leave whatever
you&rsquo;re doing and do a little errand for
your own true Loved One?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can</i> I!&rdquo; returned Patty. &ldquo;Your word is
my law!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goody girl! Well, then, go with all possible
secrecy,&mdash;with bated breath and muffled
tread, and all that, to my rooms at Mrs.
Richards&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so. Don&rsquo;t faint, but remember you&rsquo;re
a soldier&rsquo;s bride,&mdash;or will be some day,&mdash;and
defying conventions go to said rooms on an
errand for me. Will you, Patty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s tone changed to a serious note, and
Patty knew at once it was one of those important
matters with which she was sometimes
entrusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. Tell me exactly what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go there, as soon as you can, and tell Mrs.
Richards who you are. She will take you to
my rooms, and from the top drawer of my chiffonier
get a large white envelope,&mdash;not the blue
one,&mdash;that&rsquo;s tucked half under a pile of handkerchiefs.
Take it back to Rose&rsquo;s with you,
and I&rsquo;ll send there for it. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my liege lord, and I fly to obey. Oh,
I just love to do such things for you, Billy-Boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut along, then, and don&rsquo;t let the grass grow
under your tiny buckled slippers. Bye-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>So Patty &ldquo;cut along,&rdquo; Mrs. Barrett being
more than willing to lend her car, and soon
the house was reached.</p>
<p>Mrs. Richards heard Patty&rsquo;s request and at
once took her up to Farnsworth&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Miss Fairfield,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the chiffonier. Help yourself. My,
but there&rsquo;s a lot of secret errand work going
on. I don&rsquo;t know how Captain Farnsworth
gets into a day&rsquo;s work all he has to do! I
should think he&rsquo;d be worn out, and I rather
think he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the lady rattled on, Patty opened
the designated drawer and quickly found the
envelope in question. About to close the
drawer again, her eye was caught by a packet
of letters tied with blue ribbon. Struck by the
sight of such unofficial-looking documents in
Bill&rsquo;s possession, she glanced curiously at the
outside one. It had no envelope and in a
feminine handwriting she saw the words, &ldquo;Oh,
you dear, splendid big hero, how I do love
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily realising what she was doing, she
pushed the drawer shut and declared herself
ready to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got what you want?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Richards,
pleasantly. &ldquo;Sorry Lena isn&rsquo;t home. My
daughter, you know. She&rsquo;d so love to see you,
she&rsquo;s just crazy to meet Captain Farnsworth&rsquo;s
lady-love. Lena&rsquo;s a bit jealous of you, too!
She thinks the Captain&rsquo;s about the most wonderful
man on earth! Mind the steps. This
hall&rsquo;s a bit dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Patty was rolling off toward the Barrett
house. Her heart was in a turmoil. What
did that packet of blue-tied letters mean?
They were no government documents, of that
she was sure. They might be cipher letters or
code affairs, and really be of military matters
after all.</p>
<p>She tried to think this, but circumstantial evidence
was too strong. The girlish writing, the
words addressed to the big hero, the blue ribbon,&mdash;all
seemed to say that Bill had had
letters from somebody,&mdash;and poor Patty fell a
victim to the green-eyed monster, and jealousy
gnawed at her heartstrings.</p>
<p>The messenger came and Patty gave him the
important envelope, feeling a pride in her
ability to help, yet still downcast about the blue
ribboned packet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>When Farnsworth arrived at the party that
night, Patty determined to ask him to explain.
She had had half a dozen minds about the
matter, first decided to make no mention of it,
then concluding she could never be happy again
until she had heard his confession or defence.
Perhaps some infatuated little goose had written
to him,&mdash;and, perhaps he had never even
answered her. But then, why keep them so
carefully and so sentimentally?</p>
<p>In a dainty fluffy white frock, Patty awaited
Farnsworth&rsquo;s coming. The party was a large
one, but in the Barrett house were many alcoves
and nooks where one could hold a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>And so, it was in one of these that Bill finally
found his disconsolate little love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sweetness,&rdquo; and the familiar voice
reached her ears just before Farnsworth strode
into view. With a quick glance around, he took
her in his arms for a swift, silent kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be careful!&rdquo; breathed Patty. &ldquo;Some
one will see us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so; I reconnoitred first. And how is
my Posy Blossom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;that is, &rsquo;most all right,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
Patty looked doubtfully at the loving face bending
above her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it,&mdash;what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which, being interpreted, means something
pretty awful! Don&rsquo;t try to fool me, Pattibelle!
Have you been flying again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; and then Patty gave a long, steady
look into Farnsworth&rsquo;s blue eyes. What she
saw there was so reassuring, so absolutely all-powerful
to clear away her troubles, that she
laughed outright and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear, splendid old thing, you! I&rsquo;m
not worthy of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my child, is the one thing I won&rsquo;t
allow you to say, and unless you retract it,
there&rsquo;ll be grave trouble with tumultuous consequences.
Do you take it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; and Patty saw from Bill&rsquo;s
smile that unless she did he would indeed bring
about some &ldquo;tumultuous consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&mdash;I do,&rdquo; she said, hastily, as he
prepared to swoop her into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough. Say, &lsquo;I am far too
good for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commanding officer conquered, and unable
to avoid the issue, Patty said, in a meek
little voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far too good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you are! Now, what&rsquo;s this
other matter, and then we can go out to the
party proper. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll come after us
if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; and Patty faced him squarely,
and beamed into his wondering face. &ldquo;Yes, I
mean that. But I&rsquo;ll tell you. I saw a packet
of love letters in your chiffonier, and I just want
to tell you that I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s all right, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;<i>n-not</i>
jealous! I am <i>not</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you Blossom-faced little goose! Oh,
Patty Precious, thank you for dem kind woids!
Those letters, as you so sapiently assume, are
not of a nature to rouse your jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he told her what they were and of Lena&rsquo;s
request to leave them there for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I forgot all about them,&rdquo; he concluded
his tale, &ldquo;nor would I have expected you to
doubt my faithfulness and loyalty if you did
see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Patty happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t, but it was a narrow
squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Patty only smiled at him, and they both
knew that neither had reason to doubt the other
in any way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>The party went off gaily. But though no hint
was dropped, somehow there was a feeling in
the air as of a farewell occasion, and Patty
felt a vague unrest.</p>
<p>But it was the next day before she learned the
truth.</p>
<p>In the morning Farnsworth came to the Barrett
house and the moment Patty saw him, she
knew he had come to say good-bye.</p>
<p>With a white face and trembling lips she met
him at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come for a walk, will you, dear?&rdquo; Farnsworth
said gently.</p>
<p>She ran for her wraps, and soon they were off
by themselves. Unheeding the people in the
streets, they wandered far off toward the less
crowded areas, and after a time Farnsworth
told her that he was to sail that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Patty, bravely struggling
to keep back her tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good,&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t make it harder for you by weeping and
wailing and gnashing my teeth,&mdash;but, oh, my
Little Billee,&mdash;I think I shall die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Patty! Do you really care like
<i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do! I <i>do</i>! I didn&rsquo;t know it myself
till just this minute! Captain, my Captain, I
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> part from you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t, Blossom Bride, you shall go
with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty looked up in amazement, and saw in
Farnsworth&rsquo;s eyes a look she had never seen
before. He seemed almost transfigured, the
joy fairly radiated from his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;the reason I was going
without you was because I didn&rsquo;t think you
loved me <i>quite</i> well enough to go too. Do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had paused, and stood facing each
other, with quickly beating hearts. There were
no passers-by, and the sun shone straight down
on Patty&rsquo;s face, as she looked up at his
question.</p>
<p>She knew all it meant, all it implied, and with
a firm voice that had a glorious, triumphant
ring in it, she said, &ldquo;I do, my Heart&rsquo;s Dearest,
I <i>do</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Farnsworth hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Patty assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to the ends of the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Billee!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>And right there, in broad daylight, he clasped
her in his arms and gave her a kiss that sealed
the compact once and for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hop around,&rdquo; he said, laughing for
very joy. &ldquo;Oh, Patty, we must skittle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will! We can do it. I don&rsquo;t care for
anything but to go with you,&mdash;always with you.
Are you sure I <i>may</i> go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I looked out for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You expected me to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped, Patty, I only hoped. Now I&rsquo;ll get
you back to Rose&rsquo;s and you and she fix up the
wedding-bells. I&rsquo;ll breeze in about seven with
the minister. Can&rsquo;t get things fixed before that.
Darling! I&rsquo;m crazy! You <i>won&rsquo;t</i> change your
mind&mdash;no, I know you won&rsquo;t, my true, my loyal
Patty Blossom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some scurrying about when Patty
told Rose. That efficient young woman telephoned
for caterers, florists and musicians.</p>
<p>She called up friends and invited them. She
gave orders right and left, and harangued
Patty in the meantime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for a rest first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go straight
to your room and lie down. I&rsquo;ll be there in a
few minutes. Helen will help you dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And right here for about the first time in her
life Bumble showed efficiency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will. Come along, Patty,
and take it easy. There&rsquo;s lots of time before
seven o&rsquo;clock, and you&rsquo;ve nothing to do but
dress. Come along with your old reliable,&mdash;your
standby, the steady-going Bumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relieved to get away from Rose&rsquo;s fluster and
hurry, Patty went with Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do it, Bumble,&rdquo; she said, as if
by way of apology. &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> stay here and let
him go away, so I&rsquo;m going, too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you are,&rdquo; and Helen nodded, understandingly.
&ldquo;And, oh, by the way, Patty,
where&rsquo;s your wedding gown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! Where is it?&rdquo; and Patty began
to look over her frocks in the wardrobe.
&ldquo;This rose-coloured one, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy; white, if it&rsquo;s only a tub frock! Let&rsquo;s
see your white ones. Ah, here we are!&rdquo;
Helen took down a white chiffon, daintily embroidered,
and pronounced it the very thing.</p>
<p>Patty dressed at once, saying laughingly that
Bill <i>might</i> make an even earlier start than now
planned.</p>
<p>And just as the bride-to-be completed her
toilette, a commotion down stairs announced the
arrival of her father and Nan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&rdquo; she cried, in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for your wedding, my little
girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairfield, taking her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;how did you know? How did you
get here so quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Bill,&rdquo; said Nan, laughingly; and then
others crowded in, and all was bustle and
excitement.</p>
<p>At seven, Farnsworth came, looking stunningly
handsome in his uniform and with a
glow of happiness on his fine, kindly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i>, Patty?&rdquo; he whispered, as he
met her in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sure</i>, Little Billee,&rdquo; she answered, happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t regret the gorgeous wedding
you were planning for June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this better,&rdquo; she said, simply.</p>
<p>And indeed, as a wedding, the occasion was
all that could be desired.</p>
<p>As if by magic, flowers had bloomed everywhere.
Guests in festal garb had arrived, and
at last, to the soft strains of some stringed instruments,
Patty walked with her father to meet
the man to whom she so willingly and gladly
entrusted her life&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>Then the guests crowded about with gay
greetings and good wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall miss you, Patty,&rdquo; said Phil Van
Reypen, his face clouded at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Philip, do, please! But let
me tell you a great secret; something you don&rsquo;t
dream of,&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patty smiled mysteriously, and whispered low,
in Philip&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your girl is waiting for you. She doesn&rsquo;t
know it,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know it,&mdash;but <i>I</i> do! When
I come back from France&mdash;I hope everybody
will know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Reypen looked a little self-conscious, but
gaily protested he didn&rsquo;t know what she was
talking about.</p>
<p>And then, the time came to go. Like a dream,
Patty saw the people all about; saw herself being
whisked upstairs and put into a travelling
gown; saw Nan and Helen packing things; saw
a maze of faces, a whirl of good-byes&mdash;and
then,&mdash;she was alone with Farnsworth in a
motor-car&mdash;and they were rolling away, as the
jubilant orchestra played &ldquo;For the Flag and
the Girl Back Home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>did</i> Father and Nan get there?&rdquo; Patty
asked, as she emerged from her husband&rsquo;s first
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent for &rsquo;em. Telephoned early this
morning, and they just made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early this morning! You hadn&rsquo;t asked me
to go, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Billee! You <i>knew</i> I&rsquo;d go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, My Little Girl, I <i>knew</i> you&rsquo;d go. I
learned yesterday that you loved me&mdash;<i>almost</i>
enough. So I sent for your people, in case my
hopes proved true, and today you found out
that you couldn&rsquo;t get along without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. You are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord and master, it would seem,&rdquo; and
Patty&rsquo;s lovely face flushed with happiness and
content. Farnsworth drew her close as he
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are my Patty Bride!&rdquo;</p>
